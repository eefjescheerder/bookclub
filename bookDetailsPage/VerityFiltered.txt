Reading POV taking knife , exposing nerve body , pouring vinegar . To truthful I n't remember . Every time spelt , I read , instantly brain self-preservation , erases letters I . Loren ? Mulan ?

I put hand mattress lift floor , immediately shift backward palms I catch Verity watching . Her head different position , turned , eyes . How I imagined Verity time 'd unexpectedly turn creepy head heroineüò≠üò≠ Alright I apologise .... You Verity , silly goose , time life I. blood runs cold eyes pulled figure standing top stairs . She ‚Äô standing , watching husband mouth roams breast . My entire body stiffens beneath Jeremy . Verity ‚Äô fists clench sides rushes back direction room . Whoever thinks letter real , explain comedy ( funnier context I promise ) . I half fully hoping Verity chase petrified ass house seal , traumatisation future years therapy is.So missed opportunitiesüòîI bet time rose `` coma '' gave Lavan premature heart attack , giggled maniac carrying bullshit . Really reason ( making Lowyn age 10 years time breath ) , Verity remain fav . I believe Jeremy fell love , smelly sock character Lavash married genius wife . Talk downgrade . ONCE AGAIN DID SHE MURDER CHILDREN ? ? Yes , n't creepy . I disagree I found Louwon hair raising . I sleepwalking ? ? Straight outta horror movie .

And I mad shocked , I simply n't . Verity carried book kinda brain dead 99.9 % , change power . EDIT 08.2022 : 8 months I 've decided 're gon talk ending . Here 's hot . If I HAD pick team , I 'm gon choose letter . As 've established , The FMC sleepwalking red flag MMC n't . Personally impressed author 's ability manipulate readers favourite feelings , Jeremy Lochness monster turning real villains phenomenal plot twist ... WOULD BE book written , smart ( obvious ) foreshadowing . Unfortunately n't , manuscript legitimate satisfying letter infuriating . : I I hated book squint YOU WILL SEE I mention positive highlights . Like comedy . A+ miss Hoover . Or Verity determined , obsessive psycho dreams . And I sad scene ( When Jeremy pulled daughter river ) .Yuh 's it.EDIT 10.2022 : I 've read bonus chapter I sufferingüòç Full Review : Maybe I stop reading Colleen Hoover , books 's . Anyhow , I reason I coming back , plots interesting execution falls flat . OK ... I begin mess ? The story captivating , probably plot I 've Colleen Hoover books . Everything sucked . The characters shallow convoluted , I relate Lowen , I disliked I dislike Colleen Hoover 's characters . They similar personalities offer . Maybe sound righteous wrong places . All characters writes cookie cutter adult contemporary heroines , wrapped tragedies life . There distinct 'voice ' Hoover 's characters 's shame plots sets , characterization . You things feel theory ? But practicality , make ? That 's CH writes . Speaking characters , Jeremy special . He n't play role book , actively . He serve Verity 's storyline love interest . And 's . He personality dry leaf Verity Lowen obsessed ... question day . Jeremy enigmatic , mysterious , 's biggest problems book . He badly written , soooo Hoover character . Why I ? The fact characters OK cheat Jeremy 's wife camatose SAME house made things worse . And constantly justify . Now I intended fact showed remorse make hate . The book acknowledge cheating , retribution , consequence actions - brushed . When book problematic aspects , 's perfectly . When aspects romanticized flaws pointed ( ) , problem . With Lowen Jeremy acknowledging fact cheated , sends wrong message . Verity supposed psychotic obsessive wife Jeremy hated children born . Again , sounds theory . The plotline give chills ends cartoonish cringey . Jeremy cement wall personality , obsession made . Still , 'character ' . CH write dark character , honestly wattpad-esque writing , impact . I glad author different , writing changed books n't cover bigger holes . I talked characters , biggest issue , specially I prefer characterisation plot . Here list reasons Verity sucks . 1 . It 's erotica pages pages repetitive sex scenes ? In fact Verity Jeremy 's entire story . It annoyed clouded story time . The book 10 % story 90 % sex scenes . The publisher market erotica 's case ? ? ? Why problem ? Missed opportunity . Using sex tool fill Verity Jeremy 's storyline lazy writing , scenes give Jeremy personality explore aspects relationships . 2 . CH bestseller , TERRIBLE writing tragedy trauma . Both needlessly characters back stories important part personalities treated dismissively . The MC mom died cancer month ago 's talked chapters , 's forgotten quickly Lowen horny remember . The died front ? No follow trauma , . It served meet Jeremy . Hoover takes heavy plot points add drama , treats . You shove traumatic event vain add substance . A well-rounded protagonist formed relying trauma . If purpose sympathize Lowen make edgy , failed . I authors trauma porn , excessively events riddle backstories current stories . This obvious pattern CH books . MC tragic past , asshole love interest equally tragic circumstances = sexy times . Jeremy 's daughters died wife coma , character showed sadness lot paragraphs describing crushed . Guess horny OK cheat wife . Oh solution ? Transfer nursing home hook Lowen ? Bad execution , writing , . The realizes truth Verity kind kills ? It 's treated . No consequence ? He make lie incident live life Lowen ... fuck ? Where PTSD ? Where follow trauma messed mental health murderer murderous wife ? 3 . THAT ENDING .... THAT DAMN ENDING . I reviews I dislike MOST author endings . She 's writing . There huge lead Verity NOT comatose creepy . No psychotic behavior ? She opens eyes admit lying 's ? ? ? Then ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Like point psychotic character gon ? ? ? It felt flat ? ? ALSO letter makes doubt Verity victim Jeremy villain ? ? Like 's amazing twist , 's CH hard . This kind plot twist overdone , 's cliche find horror movies thrillers early 2000s . I expected . In nutshell , I ISSUES book . It . But Hoover I part ways . I n't reading books anymore . HEYYYYY ! ! ! Listen Novels & amp ; Nonsense Podcast hear discuss book star reviews . Ca n't wait hear thinküíñ Writing : offensively bad/5 | Plot : nonexistent/5 | Ending : abysmal/5 THE PLOT Lowen struggling writer opportunity lifetime co-write series acclaimed author , Verity Crawford . When arrives Verity 's home research , disturbing autobiography revealing truth tragic events life . Should Lowen Verity 's `` dreamy '' husband , Jeremy , wassup ? Or sex instead ? Find ! MY OPINION NOW LET 'S BUCKLE TF IN BECAUSE IT 'S ABOUT TO BE A ROUGH RIDE ( sexual kind Verity LOVED ) . I `` short '' , I 'm I . This book tops Stay Awake Unmissing MILE . I picked romance n't I literally Goodreads Colleen Hoover book . So I find , I , ... curiosity killed . OK . SO LET 'S GET INTO IT . - Lowen unnecessary . Literally story told POV . You 've diary entries POV , Jeremy struggling real life , BAM `` twist '' . Not unnecessary , ANNOYING . BIG pick energy . So Amos choking rock bottom sexing comatose woman 's husband marital bed chill ? Ight . And honestly sleepwalking story create empathy reader garbagio . - The writing appallingly . This BEYOND closed caption ass writing . Even blind person n't detail . Did Verity 's writing software choice Microsoft word ? No . Did Lowen picked drink , stove , filled bowl spaghetti , reheated microwave , fridge grab glass water sitting dining room table ? NO . But . - The gratuitous sex literally 14 boy 's wet dream . DISGUSTING . I literally skipped PAGES PAGES sex . What 50 shades gross ? How add story ? If 're horny , 's p0rn . PLZ . We n't `` thriller . '' ALSO . The `` I exaggerating sake '' n't hold WHEN YOUR OTHER CHARACTERS ARE LITERALLY SEXING IN THE EXACT WAY YOU DEPICTED IT IN THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY SO ? ? ? ? ? ? ? - Jeremy personality wet cardboard box . Legit ANYONE fall love said/did substance . This call dickmatized . Free ladies . - Also , ... book favours writers tbh . Saying shit `` I write suspense novels , course I girlfriend '' n't make ? ? ? ? I 'm WOW HER BRAIN , I 'm ... wow .... brain ? What correlation ? I 'M ABOUT TO WRITE SOME SPOILERS SO SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM IF YOU HAVE N'T READ THIS BOOK - Plot holes ? Nah , plot CRATERS . How fake brain scans ? Why n't Jeremy kill home hospital ? ( I missed ? ) Girl night sneaking opening bank accounts n't reach friend HALP ? ? ? And n't autobiography reason , publisher corroborate story 're telling discussed afterward ? ? ? ? - The letter atrocious . A perfect authors hand-hold reader twist make lands . I n't perfect play-by-play pretending ass letter . I gleaned `` SIKE I WAS FAKING . '' - Lowen `` forgiving '' `` justifying '' Jeremy 's double murder attempts brutal . C ‚Äô . Not women 's history month . PROS AND CONS Pros : I finished plenty laughs ChantelCons : I read Me , rollerblading therapist ‚Äô office heart-shaped sunglasses pi√±a colada dropping book desk loud thud : Boy talk today ! Why read Verity pull Ouija board summon demon hell ? I 'm ‚Äô effect . I finished book feeling completely sapped life , I 've bleeding freely past hours instead simply reading . That ending . What hell . If I shake head dissolve memory , disarrange , I . Because things I ‚Äô braced , it.Right . Let 's talk plot.Lowen Ashleigh set free long tedium daily life ‚Äô employed Jeremy Crawford ghostwrite remaining books popular series wife , Verity , unable finish due unfortunate accident . Lowe acquiesces spirit hope : opportunity acquire small measure celebrity celebrity oxygen fire career . But prepares Lowe Verity ‚Äô autobiography , accidentally stumbles day . For horror . Verity ‚Äô secrets paint different picture Lowen knew Verity , Jeremy , lives . But sooner , things , truth spill , fraught waiting in-between , havoc screaming loss . ‚Äú After , house full Chronics . The tragedy long overdue. ‚Äù I love books make backtrack declarations preference . The books catch completely off-guard , astonish , toes . Verity I expected , I . I picked great deal skepticism . I enjoy Hoover 's previous work , n't Verity tip scales . I ‚Äô happier wrong book absolutely lives buzz.Verity huge departure Hoover 's catalogue . It 's fiendishly clever , mind-bending whirligig & nbsp ; book . The plot hall mirrors vacant reflection , including live . Hoover draws & nbsp ; world illusion informs reality , time enfolds hauntingly . She lures tricks wrong-foots . Always , wields unreliable characters stunning effect : confounding , disturbing delighting turn . Not , ‚Äô ‚Äô revealed . And I entrapped story long I realized net cast.The book 's biggest triumph sheer energy threaded pages , feels uncontrollable , perfectly control author . I Hoover makes feel Lowe ‚Äô deep-skin unease confusion 's . You danger pulsing , scarcely freshly hideous future taking shape ahead , feel . In short , I Lowe , I ‚Äô hell . I ‚Äô impressed courage I ‚Äô preoccupied repeating litany ‚Äú GET OUT OF THERE , YOU IDIOT ‚Äù head.And , God , ending . That shit struck backhanded . I 'm reverberating . Because 's : Verity offers reader solidity truth hold hands . Even I reading rereading chapter I mining clues , make felt utterly senseless . Everything I ‚Äô read point felt false memory I left shaking fist book leaving hideous note . Because , what.So , . I 'm story haunt long time . Bold . Unrelenting . All-consuming . Creepy . Unputdownable.What I ‚Äô appreciate Colleen Hoover ‚Äô work‚Äîwhether ‚Äô emotionally charged love story case , suspense‚Äîis penchant pushing boundaries . For telling unexpected story . ‚Äú It ‚Äô things . Bad words , , scenes. ‚Äù Hoover preempted Verity ‚Äô release warning sorts‚Äîalthough facetious comical delivery , ‚Äô sensitive readers heart . This storyline dark , lives characters inhabit pages perfect‚Äîso , ‚Äô kid ‚Äô . Verity horrifying , maddening , what-the-hell-inducing , ‚Äô sustenance bibliophile satisfy craving different . From chapter , ‚Äô blatantly obvious entirely different side Hoover ‚Äô psyche typical love stories . Blood spatter accompanies all-consuming , addictive quality words . Storytelling power crawl inside mind , , demand undivided attention . Lowen ‚Äô life literally shambles‚Äîher mom passed , ‚Äô broke , brink eviction ‚Äô talented author , crippling anxiety involved marketing fans made work popular.It ‚Äô opportunity lifetime uproots Lowen hustle bustle Manhattan quiet Vermont countryside . Contracted publisher ghostwrite remaining books uber-popular series author involved accident , Lowen work ahead . Research lands Verity Crawford ‚Äô home office , indicate direction author wanted series . Instead , finds caught-up Verity ‚Äô life . Living home , sleeping bed , spending time Verity 's husband , Jeremy , young . Inescapable grief pain marring . Most surprising level creepiness Hoover managed incite . A level seasoned suspense writers fail attain . From reads genre consistently watches horror , ‚Äô feat feel level anxiety . For stomach twisted knots , anticipation ‚Äô come‚Äîbut , happened.And finale .
