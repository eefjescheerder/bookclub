hi as a 2019 San Francisco lesbian I'm here for the 1950s San Francisco gays ↠ 5 starsA historical fiction set in 1950's San Francisco, focusing on lesbian culture and the coming of age of a Chinese American? More of this please. In an era brimming with disruption and upheaval, the neon lights of a lesbian bar known as the Telegraph Club offer sanctuary to those in need of it. To a young girl questioning her identity, the dark nights and lively shows beckon her, bringing with them perhaps the very answers she’s been looking for. To do so, she’ll enlist the help of an unlikely friend and together they will go forth, unlocking the very secrets that the club has to offer them.This is a perfect storm of a novel. A book that broke me down almost as many times as it lifted me up. The descriptive narrative, reminiscent of other historical fiction I have read in the past and enjoyed, led me gently into its waters, before quickly amping up the drama. In this incredible story, Malinda Lo gives reference to an era not long past, and the lives of those that have been swept beneath the carpet of history. The central focus on the historical events of the time period, specifically the red scare and the bar raids of the 1950’s, were both well researched and thoroughly examined in their exposition. At its heart, Last Night at the Telegraph Club explores the challenging conditions associated with the era, yet manages to imbue a sense of warmth and belonging in every aspect of the novel. A feeling that remains constant, even during some of the darker moments of the narrative. One of the more compelling points throughout though is the main character's journey towards discovering her queer identity and the coming into her identity as a Chinese American. Especially as this was a time in America when neither were tolerated. Enter into all of this the exploration of the lesbian bar scene, which was just everything to me. I absolutely loved how it tied together with self discovery and a love realization. There was something so wholesome in Lily finding out that love had been by her side all along. It made my heart happy. Basically I adored everything about this, and can I just say, found lesbian family is superior to every other trope out there? I’m seriously expecting more of this in the future. Give the people what they want. I don't really have anything more to say except that this book means so much to me, and i'll be thinking about its ending until the end of time. I’m only just realizing how much I love bittersweet endings and books that leave things open ended, which this does beautifully. For those of you seeking a book that will leave an impact, look no further. Last Night at the Telegraph club is a book for those constantly in search of something, whose lonely hearts demand they answer its call. Trigger warnings: parental abuse, sexism, misogyny, racism, racial slurs, deportation, death of a loved one, homophobia, internalized homophobia, miscarriage.  I try to read basically everything.I am a book nerd in a way that is all-encompassing, not limited to any genre or niche but instead poisoning every category of literature (as well as books that could never be called literature even if you were being nice) in order to be absolutely as annoying as possible to both everyone I know in real life and everyone on this website.That being said:1) I have read less young adult stuff this year than ever in my life, and2) recently I have decided to all but give up on historical fiction.I can explain both, as I'm sure you are relieved to know. YES! you shout in the privacy of your own home. Another review from emma with an unnecessarily high word count!I know. I'm excited too.I read less and less YA because I am both legally and technically (and in no other ways) an adult now. I pay an electric bill sometimes, when my roommate Venmo charges me. I pay rent all the time. I am 23 years old physically, even as I vary between 12 and 74 emotionally. Because I am a grumpy elderly person I get mad at teens. So when I read books about teens I get mad at the books. So it seems better for us all if I just stick to my General Fiction section where I am welcome in my curmudgeonliness.The historical fiction part is because I cannot f*cking stand when modern writes write old-timey. I mentioned this in a wildly ranty review recently. I can't remember which. But if you're feeling like I'm repeating myself, a) you're right and b) get used to it because I am REALLY running out of review ideas.Anyway.All of this is to say that this is YA historical fiction and therefore everything in me advised against reading it and yet I liked it so much.Very lovable characters. Very sweet romance. Very interesting and believable setting. It was good stuff.I can't believe I read a million-page-long young adult historical and liked it to this extent. Thank you as always for knowing me and my reading taste better than I know myself, s.penkevich.Bottom line: What a pleasant surprise, for once!-------------------pre-reviewhm okay so this is everything.review to come / 4 stars---------upon further reflection, i'm stealing lily's idea and reading only books by asian authors this month!book 1: the incendiariesbook 2: last night at the telegraph club  too many flashbacks to straight people The cover of this book is absolutely stunning, but the actual story didn't have the same impact that the cover did. While I found the picture of life for a Chinese American girl in 1950s San Francisco fascinating, the story seemed to move at a snail like pace.I enjoyed Lily and Kath's relationship, but I'd be lying if I didn't admit that I found the Telegraph Club, it's performers and patrons more interesting. Thinking back on it, I can't really say who Kath was, she was very generic and aside from liking planes, was almost a dreamgirl-lesbian character designed to fit Lily perfectly.The ending of the book, and Lily's life after a major event, should have been a good chunk of the book I felt, not relegated to a discussion in the epilogue. The story doesn't really get interesting until the last 30%, so if the first 70% was cut down to expand the more interesting events, this could have been a 4 or 5 star read.  Powiem szczerze- mało młodzieżowa ta młodzieżówka. Jest bardzo powolna, nieśpieszna i nie przynosi większych zaskoczeń. Uwielbiam książki z elementem wlw i ciągle mi ich mało. Jestem pod wrażeniem. i absolutely adored this book!! last night at the telegraph club is probably the most engaging and vivid historical novel i've read thus far. it feels firmly rooted in 1950s san francisco, where 17-year-old chinese american lily lives and has her sapphic awakening.it's about a lot of things: dreaming about outer space &amp; things bigger than your world, tender first love, close family bonds &amp; conflict, childhood friendships that eventually run their course, foggy san francisco, growing up in chinatown during the red scare, and the sobering realization that you are not the nice straight kid that everyone expects you to be. but most of all, this is a novel about the need for representation.at the start of the book, lily is absolutely ravenous for sapphic representation. this is something that she doesn't even have the words for; she just knows that she is different in some way. she has a desperate need to see this otherness in people around her, lest be swallowed by confusion and isolation.
  She couldn't put into words why she had gathered these photos together, but she could feel it in her bones: a hot and restless urge to look - and, by looking, to know.
&amp;
  She still liked to look, to feel the way it tugged at something deep within her. A spark of recognition, or a glow of hope.
unbelievably troubling to grow up and find lgbt+ representation only in ads for male impersonators at nightclubs, or in tawdry pulp novels with tragic endings.when lily does finally discover the world of the telegraph club and its small community women who love women, it's a shock to her system. less shocking is the fact that she is usually the only asian american woman in this lesbian space. even so, finding representation via community is a powerful thing:
  She realized, with a jolt, that the city must be peppered with women who frequented the Telegraph or similar clubs; women who watched performers like Tommy Andrews, made friends with each other, made girlfriends with each other. At each intersection she cast skittish glances at the women waiting for the light to change, wondering if she was one of them too, or her, or her.
the book is full of vivid, cinematic imagery, and feels wonderfully historical. so many places and streets are identified by name, and i'm sure i'd enjoy it even more if i was familiar with san francisco's geography.and it took me a while to fully engage, but after the halfway mark, i absolutely devoured the story.lily and kath's romance is soft and tender, and feels realistic for tentative teenagers trying to figure things out. i wish their relationship could be explored in more depth, but i still adore their sweetness.i also adore lily as a character. she's thoughtful and introspective, and such a sweet balance of naive and courageous. i find it really fascinating that she is forced to have a "coming out" conversations of sorts, with both her childhood friend and her mother, despite the lack of cultural precedent for coming out. obviously they use different language than we have today, and much is left unsaid. but for lily, coming out means speaking her truth, and being loyal to herself and to her love with kath.my only critique would be about the flashback chapters from lily's relatives' POVs, which close each of the book's six parts. these are interesting for providing additional characterization and broader cultural context, but i think they really break the flow and momentum of lily's story. also, they're each accompanied with a timeline of historical events and significant events in lily's family. good background, but the timelines overlap with each other from chapter to chapter, and i found it really confusing to see them piece by piece like this.i'm so glad malinda lo wrote this book. not only did lily's story come alive for me, but i learned a lot from lo's long and informative author's note. she fills in some extra historical context for the impeccably well-researched story, and cements it as a representation novel. last night at the telegraph club both portrays a character in dire need of cultural representation for people like her, "learning how to live as both chinese american and lesbian in spaces that often did not allow both to coexist," and provides representation for readers today.&nbsp;so much love!!!  4.50 Stars. Now I know why this book had a lot of hype surrounding it. It was excellent and I’m glad I got to read it before the year ended. I have read quite a few of Lo’s books, but it has been around 9 years since I have read any of them. I was very interested to see how she has evolved as an author and all I can say is wow. This felt like a huge step-up from her earlier books and it was really cool to see the author she has become. I don’t know what happened but I had no idea what this book was really about. For some reason I thought it was a cozy-like mystery with some humor. I don’t know if it was the cover or reading reviews wrong, but I screwed this one up. Instead, this is a story about a young Asian-American woman growing up in the 50’s while coming to terms with her sexuality. Asian rep is so lacking in mid-century historic-fiction that I’m struggling to even name another book I could loosely compare this one too. Anyway, this just felt so well done and while it was fiction, Lo did her research. I would implore people to read her history notes in the back of the book. They were a fascinating read and contained some information I never knew and probably never would have known. I do have to give a big tissue warning. I lost track but I think it was the last 20% of the book that I almost went through a whole box of tissues. There were times this book slowed-down a bit, and I felt like there was some info that was not needed, but when the book picked back up, it delivered a big emotional gut punch (in the best reading way). TLDR: The hype around this book is real and this was an excellent historic-fiction, sapphic, YA book. If not for a few parts I didn’t think were necessary to the story, and a few character updates that were unfortunately missing, this would have been an easy full 5 star book for me. As it stands it is still one of the better books I’ve read in 2021, and I’m very impressed with Lo’s growth as an author. This is an easy one to recommend to YA fans.  Przeczytana już dawno temu. Będę Wam ją polecał bez końca! Naprawdę jakościowa i wartościowa powieść YA!  this is perhaps one of the most interesting and informative books i've ever read. the historical and cultural parts were everything my gay history heart could hope for and more. malinda lo transports you to a whole different place and time, and it felt so vivid; i could literally picture everything, as if i was, indeed, right there!the thing, though, is that i expected to feel this sort of things-not for the background, but for the characters and their relationships. i definitely rooted for lily and kath, there's no way to deny that because i really did hope they would find their way together, but...i didn't care that much on the other hand? like, it's hard to describe because i wanted it for them, but i, for a few reasons, couldn't really feel invested.the writing is perfect for the culture and history. it just fits, as if malinda lo was made to write this, but it was also distant. some part of me thinks the author did this on purpose to really show the "vibe" of the story, of the time. but it really brought down how invested i was in the story and the way i felt for the characters.overall, the story didn't feel too memorable for me. the things behind it (historical and cultural aspects) did. they stood out to me. but for a fiction book, that's not enough for me. i read to learn, but i also read to feel. and this book, no matter how bad i wanted it to make me feel things (from hope to fear to sadness to every other emotion), didn't deliver that.  I understand how meaningful this will likely be for some people, but it bored me. I typically read my Kindle in bed, and I would find one of two things happening with this book: either it would immediately make me sleepy, so I wouldn't read much; or I would read for what felt like hours and notice that I was barely making any progress.Seriously, almost nothing happens. There are many dangling threads and big ideas, but there is almost no plot. The only major plot development happens about 3/4 of the way through, so that last quarter of the book is interesting. But the rest is so, so dull.I'm going to put the stuff that really annoyed me behind a tag.1. The constant threat of Lily's family being deported for Communism goes nowhere. Her father gets his papers taken early in the novel, but the only way it ends up playing into the story is that it's a factor in her parents' decision to send her off to live with her aunt. The FBI or whoever never show up; there is no dramatic event regarding the threat of Communism.2. Speaking of, several characters are introduced early on before we are told they are part of a youth Communist group. We never see most of them again. One makes a brief appearance much later when we find out he's dating Lily's friend Shirley, but again... there is no scene or event that dictates them needing to be there at the novel's start.3. Kath gets arrested at the Telegraph Club and we just never find out what happens to her. When she reappears for the epilogue, there is no discussion about what happened that night, where she went, or what she's been up to for the year in between the arrest and the reunion.4. And while we never find out what happens to Kath during her arrest, we do get endless scenes of Shirley trying on dresses and competing for Miss Chinatown, even though she and Lily fall out the day of so we never get to see the contest. There's also a really long sequence of Lily and Shirley going to a museum and looking at the seals and eating lunch and MY GOD get on with it already! (This is how I felt about quite a few sections of this book.)5. There are chapters at the end of each part with flashbacks to Lily's parents and aunt, and they are an utter waste of time. The chapters from her aunt's perspective, I suppose, added context to her decision to take Lily in late in the book, but did we really need a chapter about her parents going on a date?   being a sapphic means that the only thing you know is pain. Mój wspaniały patronat 🥹 i jedna z najlepszych książek z reprezentacją wlw, jakie czytałam ❤️ (zaraz po Evelyn) I loved this!! it was so interesting getting to read about history that has largely been left unexplored or supressed and the intersection of being Chinese-American in the USA at the time of the Red Scare, as well as a young woman interested in STEM and a lesbian exploring the lesbian bar scene.I really enjoyed Lily as a character and reading from her perspective. She was really easy to empathise with and understand and I loved the journey she went on as she realised this new part of her identity and what that would mean for her. I also just adored her relationship with Kath and all of the scenes at the Telegraph Club and exploring this environment! Definitely going to be checking out some of the resources in the bibliography because I really want to learn more!My only issue is that I don't think Malinda Lo's writing works for me :// However, the writing in LNATTC was definitely preferable to her earlier work that I've read and I'll be looking out for her future works!  deeply emotionally compelling. As a chinese American femme I’m gonna need someone to step up and be my Kathleen This novel follows seventeen-year-old Lily Hu, a young Chinese American teenager coming to terms with her queerness in 1954 San Francisco. I liked how Malinda Lo wrote about the racism Lily experienced in her newfound, predominantly white queer community, as well as the homophobia she faced from her Chinese family and friends. Lily’s coming to terms with her queerness – the fear, the longing, the search for understanding and connection – all felt real and honest. Lo incorporates some interesting scenes pertaining to xenophobia and anti-communism that help ground the novel in its time period and add nuance to Lily’s experience as well as those of her family.My main disappointment from this novel comes from how I felt the Chinese American characters came across as underdeveloped. For example, Lo includes a riveting flashback scene from the perspective of Lily’s mom, Grace, though she never revisits that and by the end of the book Grace and Lily’s relationship feels underdeveloped and unfinished. Similarly, Lo drops hints that Lily’s best friend, Shirley, has some nuanced family conflict and a potentially intriguing romantic relationship, though those elements of Shirley’s character never come to fruition. It felt like Lo focused on Lily’s relationship with her white love interest Kath, which is whatever, though I wish that focus did not come at the expense of other elements of Lily’s life. Also, I feel like white queer love interests are overrepresented in queer literature, so I hope that future books can include romances and friendships between queer people of color.   l 76% l this book is basically a taste of what life would be like for a gay chinese-american teenager in 1950s san francisco. in two words: it’s rough.the whole book doesn’t focus on how difficult things were, it rather slowly builds and conveys all of the emotions that our main character feels as she discovers herself and who she loves, and then it slaps us in the face with reality. the majority of this book is slow, and most of it focuses on the thoughts of the main character and the time and place. the setting is written so expertly, i loved all of the descriptions of san francisco during that time, i could imagine everything perfectly and i could almost feel myself there on a windy and foggy day with lily and shirley, watching the ocean. my favorite part about this book was honestly just how the place and time were written, i really felt as if i were experiencing it firsthand and honestly this is one of the big reasons why i read historical fiction. i also loved how the author included chinese culture in the story, it provided some extra depth as well as diversity. near the end of the book, things get much more tense and let’s just say some shit goes down. i thought it was a very realistic portrayal of what life was like back then and how people thought, and it very well could’ve been someone’s exact experience during that time. it was hard to read about though and some of the scenes honestly made me feel sick. i really felt for the characters who had to go through that and all of the real people who had to go through things like that and worse.plot:this follows lily, a chinese-american girl, who discovers her identity and the telegraph club while trying to navigate school and her life in general, all during a dangerous time where her family may be exported from the country. i’m pretty sure this is YA, so it isn’t written in a way that is very intense or has violence or anything, but i really did feel the struggles of the main character during a time that was so difficult. during the first 75% of the book, things move really slowly and nothing bad really happens, and it isn’t until near the end when things start to go downhill and we see how bad things could get. this story is definitely slow-paced, and it isn’t action packed or anything, it mainly just focuses on the setting and normal events that can happen during one’s life.the book also includes things that aren’t wholly necessary to the development of the plot, but all in all has a positive contribution to the story and provides more details to the setting and characters.lily for the most part has a pretty mundane life, and then everything begins to change when she discovers kath and the telegraph club. i enjoyed reading her journey.the characters:lily: i think this probably just has to do with the time period, but lily was really naive and it annoyed me a lot at points. i think i would’ve enjoyed this more if the main character would’ve been more interesting, but lily just felt really boring and flat. she had no other personality traits besides being ‘a good chinese girl’ and timid and secretly a lesbian. i would’ve liked to know what personality traits she had, was she funny what things did she like etc etc. i feel like i never really got to know her besides something you could read on the back cover of a book. •shy chinese girl who wants to be good figures out that she is a lesbian and wants to go to a lesbian bar but is afraid and is torn between how she feels inside and what she ‘should’ be.• that’s it, that’s all she is. she had some good character development, but definitely just the expected kind a character like that would have. i didn’t necessarily dislike her and she worked well with the story, but she just made the whole thing seem more juvenile somehow and that was slightly annoying. kath: if there’s going to be a sequel, i think it should definitely be from oath’s pov, because we never get to know her at all in this book. we get to know random side characters better than we get to know kath. i have absolutely no idea what she’s like. it’s like lily wanted to keep her all to herself so she didn’t share her with us (and i don’t really mind that if that’s the case.) we only get kath from lily’s pov, and it seems like lily is too wrapped up in her own head to be able to tell us anything about kath and therefore it just makes kath a very underdeveloped character. shirley: for whatever reason, shirley felt like the most complicated character. i definitely judged her multiple times and then she would do things that would make me change my mind about her and then i would keep changing my mind because i could never really figure her out. i definitely disliked her most of the time, but i appreciated that she was more complicated than just a cardboard cutout of a ‘mean popular girl’ type character. she seems like she could be a real, complicated person. i disliked her a lot from where the story left off, but if there were to be a sequel i don’t think she would be irredeemable. the romance:i think the point of this book was more to show what loving someone of the same gender was like during that time than the actual relationship between lily and kath. i believed that lily and kath felt things for each other, but i didn’t feel like i really got to experience it firsthand and there wasn’t much development of the relationship itself from the readers perspective. most of their relationship seemed to happen inside lily’s head as she discovered her feelings, but not much seemed to really happen between lily and kath. which is probably realistic in real life, but not how it usually happens in books.it was refreshing but at the same time made it so that there wasn’t really any chemistry or tension between lily and kath and i wasn’t waiting for them to get together or anything like that. they were also pretty young, so maybe that played a part, and they seemed more concerned about being gay and what that meant than worrying about whether the other person liked them back. writing:the writing was good; it wasn’t significantly special and i’m not likely to quote it or anything but it did an amazing job of portraying the setting and had good descriptions of literally anything that happened in the story, down to dissecting the ice cream flavors.it was great at immersing the reader in the story and made me feel as if i were actually there. it uses a lot of smells and sights to describe the surroundings, which provided for very detailed mental images and a presence in the story.10/10 sensory language wrap-up:overall this is a good book and it’s 100% here for the gays &lt;3it feels a bit juvenile and times and moves slowly but makes up for it with the atmospheric tones and story development overall.it also gives me such nostalgia for san francisco in the 1950s although i would decidedly not want to be there________________________4 starsrep:✔︎ chinese-american lesbian mc✔︎

FICTION???I'M HERE FOR THIS.  i tried to write a review for this book when i first read it back in august, and have attempted to write several since then and,,put it off but now i’ve finished reading it for a second time i have no excuses left to put off writing a review for this so, first of all, if i were to try and rate this objectively it probably wouldn’t be a 5 star read. there’s definitely a lot of loose ends in this book, plot points that are very briefly touched on and then not spoken of again throughout the book. i feel like this would bother a lot of people so do be wary of that!! for me, though, this book was so special and important to me that i overlooked that i also think the reason i love this book so so much is because of the point in my life that i read this. as someone who spends uhhh half my life doubting my sexuality (because, like, comp het) this book that exuded lesbian culture? was everything to me like, as someone who spent a large half of the beginning of this year doubting my lack of attraction in men (because, i would like to repeat: comp het) i can clearly sense that since i first read this book at the start of august that has...actually stopped?? quite a lot?? because it’s made me feel a little (or a lot) less scared about being a lesbian?? it’s very hard to explain this without making it seem like i’m making an overly big deal of a book but!! this story really had a huge impact on me OK i loved the characters in this as well!! i can’t quite explain how much but!! i would like to meet them all pls i’m also kind of obsessed with books set in the early to mid twentieth century so like?? that with LESBIANS?? oh also the author’s note made me cry hahahaha i am finealso i love the ‘going to a bookshop after school each day to read a bit more of that one queer book they have because i can’t actually take it home’ thing because . 13 year old me says hi!!!!oh and how do i forget to mention the romance!! i loved it!!! honestly it was quite a small part of the book until very much towards the end??? BUT it was very gay and i loved it very much and i love lily and kath best lesbians the one thing i’ll mention that bothered me very slightly about this book is that despite it being so specifically about lesbian culture this book falls into the trap of a main character who is clearly written as a lesbian but!! never actually uses the word lesbian to describe herself. this didn’t make me like the book any less, because it is so so common but just wanted to mention this!!!anyway!! i love this book more than i can possibly say and i’m going to be reading it for the third time as soon as my copy arrives (hurry up pls @ the shop i ordered it from) and then probably make this review much, much longer when i think of even more things i adore about this book (what if i just,, listen to a chapter of the audiobook every night before i sleep,,that would be,,a very good idea)(also: me at the start of this review “right time to write a proper, serious review for the fave book’ the review “lesbians!!!!!!!! i love them!!!!!!! gay” )   ✨🌃🛩🪐" An unfamiliar emotion swelled inside her at this image. A strangely sharp pang for a place she had never visited. For a people she resembled but did not know.”1950s Chinatown. Sapphic. Women in STEM.Girl who wants to make planes meets girl who wants to fly. It's perfection, really. I don’t make the rules 🤷‍♀️ Taking place in 1950s Chinatown in San Fransisco, our main character Lily Hu, is a Chinese American who starts to ask herself some questions: what does she want to be when she grows up, and who she wants to be with. 👀 "That book, it was about two women, and they fell in love with each other.Have you ever heard of such a thing?"Lily's classmate, Kath, takes them to The Telegraph Club; a lesbian bar--in secret. Along with the problems of falling in love with a woman, deportation threatens her family amidst the Red-Scare paranoia. At first, the writing was a bit difficult to keep me reading. The writing itself and the book itself is objectively good, but at times I found myself disinterested. The story isn't fast-paced or action-filled, or plot-heavy, but it's not about that.The main thing this book did finely on was its beautiful depiction of youthful desire, first love, and Chinese American culture.It was incredibly detailed with the occasional flowery prose, (my fave). From the 1950s environment to the emotions of the characters, to, of course, the food!😩"Those strange women at the party seemed to see her much more clearly than she saw herself, and it was disorienting-as if her body were not her own, but capable of acting without the conscious direction of her mind, which was screaming at her to let go of Kath's hand, to go home as fast as she could, to crawl into her bed and pull the covers over her head and forget about this entire night, to forget about Tommy Andrews and the Telegraph club and all those women who looked at her and saw that she and Kath were...what?"  
  “Haven’t you ever wondered what it would be like to have nothing keeping you attached to the ground?”
Last Night at the Telegraph Club is a lovely coming of age story of Lily Hu, a 17-year-old Chinese-American, set in the 1950s in Chinatown (San Francisco).Queer Asian Historical Fiction? Women interested in STEM?? YESS YES AND YESS
  “Perhaps that was the most perverse part of this: the inside-outness of everything, as if denial would make it go away, when it only made the pain in her chest tighten, when it only made her emotions clearer.”
At first, I was having difficulties adjusting to Malinda Lo's writing style, but as chapters went by and when I was around 40%, I started warming up to it. Malinda Lo managed to capture the emotions of self-discovery, belonging, first love, and life in the early 1950s as a Chinese-American.By the author's note on the last pages, I could tell that the author did thorough research. As a result, the setting was atmospheric. The mouth-watering descriptions of the foods, the details about the 1950s Chinatown, were all beautiful. It felt as if I were transported into Lily's world.I loved Lily, her character was complex, and nicely fleshed out. I loved her curiosity and passion and her coming-out-of-age discovery and lesbian awakening. Kath's character was at first a bit bland, it was hard to tell her apart from everyone. Still, she grew on me and I found her quite fascinating in the end. The romance between them wasn't rushed, it was splendidly slowly building up until both of them are ready, and out embracing their true selves.The side characters as well were realistic. Shirley's and Lily's family's thoughts about her coming out make sense, even though it was painfully annoying. The telegraph club crew was fantastic and they too tell each different personal stories.
  “She’s having a hard time right now because you’re not what she expected. But we’re never what our parents expected. They have to learn that lesson.”
Honestly, I just started lnattc because I couldn't fathom how close I am to finishing ove. I didn't expect to very much enjoy and adore this book. This really made me feel the feels, and I loooveeed it.Overall, LNATTC was such an interesting and heartfelt read. The historical aspect was amazing. The characters were great, I liked reading from the mc's perspective. And the story was a breath of fresh air aaaa. 4 stars✨
  “There was probably a scientific explanation for it, but the older she got, the more she was inclined to give in to the feeling that these moments were glimpses into a world greater than this physical one. It was as if there were cycles that repeated themselves over and over, but most people never saw the repetition; they were too deeply enmeshed in their own path to see.”
   “lily raised her fingers to her lips as if to touch the last trace of kath’s mouth on hers. she felt a queer giddiness overtaking her, as if her body might float up from the ground because she was so buoyant with this lightness, this love.” there is nothing quite as pure as sapphic love. my heart feels so fulfilled, warm and satisfied. stories like this, with writing so full of hope and emotion, with the care taken into divulging a culture and the history attached to it, is what we, as lesbians, deserve. malinda lo i could not possibly thank you more for this or stress what it means that something so special exists for the lesbian community.   BIG LOVE.•Mam wiele książek, które skradły moje serce już od pierwszych stron, jednak tych, które zostały w nim na dłużej jest znacznie mniej. Jedną z nich jest właśnie „Ostatniej nocy w klubie Telegraph”. To jedna z tych książek, które nie tylko zachwyciły mnie wspaniałą historią, ale także wyjątkowymi bohaterkami. To niezwykle prawdziwa, chwytająca powieść o miłości dwóch kobiet- Lily oraz Kathleen, w klimacie lat 50, dziejąca się w San Francisco. Jedna z tych, które poruszyły mnie przy zakończeniu i poruszają wciąż, kiedy wracam do nich myślami.   *2.5. Não tem absolutamente NADA de errado com esse livro. Eu só acho que ele não se encaixa mais no meu perfil de leitura e acabou sendo bem mais YA/jovem do que eu imaginei que seria. Lutei pra terminar, porque não tava me importando com nada e só queria estar lendo outra coisa.  
  AUDIOBOOK REVIEW IN EN &amp; ZH-TW有聲書書評（中英對照）
ENContent warning: racism, homophobia, manipulation, mention of miscarriage, alcohol (underage drinking)
  She couldn’t find the right words for this dammed-up feeling inside, as if she were denying herself something absolutely vital, and she didn’t know why.
Last Night at the Telegraph Club is less about the romance between Lily and Kath but more about Lily trying to grasp her identity as a Chinese American lesbian in the 1950s.In the prologue, four years before the main story (1950), thirteen-year-old Lily Hu (胡麗麗) and her childhood best friend Shirley Lum attend Miss Chinatown Contest with their families. I’d say this one chapter is the summary of the entire book in one way or another as we see Lily becoming aware of skin and bodies and the interactions between her and Shirley.When Lily stumbles upon an ad for male impersonator Tommy Andrews’ performance at the Telegraph Club (1954), she is mesmerized, not quite understanding why. But she keeps the clip along with a few others in her copy of The Exploration of Space. All her dreams in one place, I think. As the new school year starts, there are only two girls left in Advanced Math—Lily herself and Kathleen Miller, who dreams of becoming a pilot. Their orbits never coincide until this very moment, and it makes all the difference.Hearing the name “Kath” makes me sigh now, and that’s how much I love the character. She is sweet and loving and I desperately wish we were able to spend more time with her instead of with Shirley. But of course, it is the preciousness of the scenes that makes everything more delicious. Told through Lily’s third-person point-of-view, we watch how she and Kath first bond over mathematical and scientific endeavors—Lily wanting to pursue a career in space science and Kath wanting to be a pilot—and their friendship slowly grows into something neither could comprehend.
  What if they were thinking of each other at the same time?
In-between each part, there are flashback chapters told through the POVs of the older generation—Lily’s mother, father, and aunt. These bring the historical stories of that generation into the plot, the generation plagued by wars and PROC overtaking China in 1949. The generation that couldn’t go back to their homeland if they wanted to. This part is a shared history with Taiwan because that was the war the Nationalist Party lost and came to the island. Even the then-First Lady of ROC Madam Chiang, someone we all learned in history textbooks in Taiwan, made a cameo.Last Night at the Telegraph Club is a very introspective story where Lily talks little and she goes about mundane things while thinking and having random thoughts. It was very relatable for me and I acutely feel every breath Lily took and every panic that shot through her head. It’s amazing how much I could feel through Lily, through Lo’s words. The story is beautiful, telling a fictionalized generational history of queer Chinese American women, a group often erased in historical records, in the 1950s San Francisco through Lily Hu’s. In this book, Lo gave voice to people like Lily Hu, and all the people who came before us (as in queer people).I absolutely love the Cantonese and Mandarin scattered throughout the story. In print, some of them were written in Traditional Chinese characters and not their romanized forms. I don’t think I’ve ever read any English books where I see Chinese characters in them. Zeller’s narration is also incredible. I love all the voices she gave the characters, the purposefully subtle accents for Joseph and Judy, Lily’s father and aunt, and how she slips seamlessly between languages. It was phenomenal.The main romance is the most gripping for me, but there are also so many important elements in the book—Chinese American culture, anti-communism, queer gatherings, etc.—all in the 1950s. I love that the older gay women, despite treating Lily as an exotic novelty, are kindhearted and shared their experiences of what it means to be queer. The racism in the 1950s, still prevalent in 2021, is evident in everything Lily and her family go through. I wish I could say that Last Night at the Telegraph Club is very much a story in the history and the present world isn’t like that anymore but I couldn’t. It pains me how everything is still relevant now.Lily and Kath. I don’t know what to say except that my heart weeps and sings for them. I imagine them staring into each other’s eyes whenever possible, unblinking with hope and love and tenderness.Reading the title of the book still gives me an indescribable ache, like something physically pressing into my sternum, just as the name Kath makes me sigh. I wish we had gotten more at the ending but I also see the necessity of stopping where it did. There is hope and joy and yearning. Lily and Kath will live in my head where all their dreams become reality as they stay at each other’s side to this day, both reaching for the sky.ZH-TW與其說「電報夜店的最後一晚」(Last Night at the Telegraph Club) 是部關於胡麗麗與凱斯米勒 (Kathleen Miller) 的愛情故事，不如說是麗麗找尋身為華裔美人與女同志的雙重身份。小說的序幕為 1950 年十三歲的麗麗與兒時好友林雪莉 (Shirley Lum) 與家人參與中國城小姐選美活動。這一章節某種程度上是整部小說的摘要：麗麗逐漸對於女人身體感到好奇以及和雪莉的互動。當麗麗意外看到女扮男裝湯米安德魯 (Tommy Andrews) 在電報夜店的演出廣告時，她為之著迷，儘管並不了解原因。但麗麗將廣告以及其他報章夾在「太空探奇」(The Exploration of Space) 中，好似搜集所有夢想。新學期開始時，高等數學班上只剩兩名女學生——麗麗以及夢想成為飛行員的凱斯米勒。過去她們的生活完全沒有交集，但此時此刻，一切將完全不同。想著凱斯的名字讓我忍不住嘆息。我想這顯示我對這個角色的眷戀。她是如此地溫柔與深情，而我希望本書更著重於她而少些雪莉的鏡頭。但也正是因為麗麗與凱斯在書中相處的時光有限讓她們的關係與連結更佳珍貴。透過麗麗第三人稱視角，我們看見她與凱斯因為對於數理的熱愛產生連結——麗麗想要從事太空相關研究而凱斯夢想飛行，而漸漸地，她們的友誼發展至前所未有的境界。在各部分間有透過老一輩的視角講述過去的事件：麗麗的母親、父親、姑姑。這些章節將歷史背景帶入主要劇情，特別是這一代身受戰爭侵擾以及 1949 年中國共產黨佔領中國大陸。這一代的華裔無法回到中國。而這一部分也和臺灣歷史息息相關，不管是國共內戰還是出現在故事中的第一夫人蔣宋美齡。「電報夜店的最後一晚」 非常著重於內心世界。麗麗並不多話，而很多時候也只是描述她從事一些生活瑣事時所思考的事情，抑或是突如其來的思緒。透過麗麗、透過作者的文字，我完完全全可以感受到麗麗經歷的每一切。也是透過麗麗的故事，我們能夠一瞥 1950 年代舊金山被歷史遺忘的華裔美人女同志們。作者讓這些歷史先驅者得以發聲。我非常喜愛故事中時而出現的廣東話與普通話。在文字中，有些部分是用繁體字書寫，而非拼音。我從來沒有在任何其他本英文小說中看過中文字。說書者的朗讀也非常超群。我很喜歡她賦予角色的聲音、麗麗父親與姑姑的腔調，以及無縫穿梭於不同語言之間。對我而言，主要的愛情故事是最引人入勝的部分，但書中也有其他非常重要的主題，包含 1950 年代的華裔美人文化、反共、同志聚會等等。雖然那些稍微年長的女同志們總是視麗麗為奇異特有種，她們依舊是好心人，也樂於分享身為同志的種種經歷。1950 年代的種族歧視在 2021 年的今天依舊普遍。我希望我能說「電報夜店的最後一晚」完完全全是個歷史故事而現今社會已不再如此，但我不能。想著今日仍與當時的點滴相似令我心痛。麗麗與凱斯。我不知道能說什麼——我的心為之哭泣與歌頌。在我腦中，我想像她們無時無刻深情對望，眼中充滿希望、愛意與無比的溫柔。看著本書的書名就讓我的胸口隱隱作痛，就像看著凱斯的名字讓我嘆息一樣。我多希望在故事的結尾能有更多的後續，但我也完全理解現有的最後一章是個完美的結局：有希望、有喜悅，也有渴望。麗麗與凱斯將深住我的腦中。在此，她們所有的夢想已然成真，而時至今日，相依相隨，一同伸向蒼穹。Buddy read with Gabriella!INITIAL THOUGHTSExcuse me as I go sob in the corner and my heart aches for more Lily and Kath content.I’m also incredibly impressed with Zeller’s narration: languages, voices, accents.  4.5 Stars
  CWs:
 Some exploration of racism, deportation, xenophobia, homophobia, underage drinking, some graphic sex, brief mention of miscarriage, some use of outdated racial and social epithets (relevant to time period), some exploration of familial estrangement and disownmentI'll just say it: this is the queer historical YA of my dreams. It manages to capture an impeccable sense of place and time while also celebrating and reclaiming queer histories. That is 100% my jam, and I think Malinda Lo absolutely nailed it.The story's intersectional lens is invaluable, especially considering the time period during which it is set. The 1950's in California were a very fraught time politically, racially, and socially. This was a time period where it was still considered unusual (and "unnecessary") for women to continue to their education. It was a time when interracial marriage was not yet legal, much less "same-sex" marriage or partnerships. It was when Red-Scare paranoia was reaching a fever pitch, and Chinese immigrants and Chinese-American citizens were being deported and discriminated against under the premise of being "Communist loyalists." As young, queer Chinese-American girl, Lily has to contend with all of these issues and figure out how to navigate a world that's very much against her.What will inevitably stick with me from this book is the way it easily could've been about trauma, repression, and the internalization of homophobia—but instead, the overarching feeling that stems from this story if one of warmth, belonging, and self-discovery. Make no mistake, it is a historically accurate narrative that addresses the all-too-real obstacles and hardships that queer people of color, especially, had to deal with during this time period, but it's more so about Lily finding ways to work around those obstacles and fighting for those few-and-far-between moments where she is free to express herself. It's about how those hardships existed, yes, but for every hardship, there was a way around it—there was a vibrant counterculture of queer people existing and thriving and loving each other.The story brilliantly captures that feeling of discovering where you belong, discovering safe spaces, and that surrender of allowing yourself to just take it all in. Those moments of Lily first entering the Telegraph Club and instinctually recognizing this dynamic, code-switching counterculture were intoxicating for me, because she's finally able to understand all the feelings she's been taught to deny and erase. More importantly, the Telegraph Club is a place that represents queer futurity and queer normalcy. For someone as young as Lily to see queer adults living their lives, forging relationships, holding everyday jobs, and celebrating their queerness out loud is life-changing. It gives her the confidence to stay true to herself, even if it would be easier to live out the "normal" life that's been laid out for her.To that end, I think one of the most effective themes in the story is an exploration of performance. As a scientifically-minded Chinese-American young woman living through the Red-Scare, Lily is constantly confronted with need to cultivate a certain "image." She has to be "a good Chinese girl" to keep her family happy, she has to present herself as "American first" in order to distance herself from "Communist sympathizers" in her community, and she has to keep her interests appropriate for "what suits a young lady." And, of course, she has to hide her queerness, which would be deemed as scandalous, illegal, and shameful. So she is constantly having to perform the role of the "perfect Chinese daughter," while also being encouraged to pursue and emulate whiteness, while also suppressing her authentic desires and feelings.Being able to "pass" in any given situation requires a certain performance, and because of that, performance is often a means of survival. As the story progresses, I think Lily is beginning to understand the tenuous relationship between "performing" and "masking," and she's learning where it's safe to drop that performance and just be herself. We also seen an aspect of literal performance at the Telegraph Club, with the headlining male impersonator known as "Tommy Andrews." This goes to show that while we may "perform" in order to hide or conceal, we also perform to lean into our authenticity and our differences, especially when our instinct to self-preserve tells us to pull back. Lily learns a great deal about living out loud, and how the most important parts of herself don't simply disappear when she occupies different spaces.Overall, this such a beautiful story of self-discovery, queer desire, and carving out space for yourself in a world that could never anticipate you. It's about tender first love, queer community, found family, and staying true to yourself even in the most trying of times. This is, by far, one of the best historical fiction books I've ever read, and I know I'll be recommending it far and wide for years to come!  TO. JEST. LITERATURA. Po zastanowieniu daję jej 3.5/5 i 4 gwiazdki w skali, bo to nie jest zła książka. Jest jednak niesamowicie powolna i dla mnie niektóre momenty zbyt przegadane. Uważam, że te 400 stron można by spokojnie zmieścić w 200. Ciężko mi się do niej przez to wracało. Doceniam ją za tło historyczne, za retro klimat i za Lily, która była po prostu precious.   The amount of positive, affirming, LGBT representation in young adult fiction has skyrocketed since I was a teenager. For that reason, every time I read a book like Last Night at the Telegraph Club, I get a little overwhelmed by how glad I am that a book like this exists. Not just so that I can read and enjoy it, but so current and future LGBT teenagers can see themselves reflected in the books they read in a way I never did. Any book that communicates a message of “LGBT people exist, LGBT people have always existed, and they’re normal and they’re worthy of love and success” is a good book as far as I’m concerned.Last Night at the Telegraph Club isn’t good just because the lesbian rep is good, although I really cannot stress enough how seen and validated I felt reading Lily’s experiences. Seeing yourself reflected in a work of fiction or music or art never gets old. In fact, my only complaint about this book – and the reason I rated it four stars instead of five – was that I wanted more exploration of Lily’s journey. I could have read another one or two hundred pages of that, and there were parts that felt a little rushed, particularly toward the end.Though I could never understand Lily’s experience as a Chinese American and the daughter of first- and second-generation immigrants, I thought they were well-written and enlightening. Particularly eye-opening for me was the way Lily was pulled in two different directions by her identities as Chinese American and as a lesbian. In Chinatown, she felt less able to express herself authentically – this I could relate to, having grown up in a religious community that was not accepting of LGBT people – but outside of Chinatown and among other (white) lesbians, she still felt like an outsider for being Chinese.This is a very character-driven book, a classic coming-of-age story and one that I think will resonate with both teen and adult readers. I haven’t read any of Malinda Lo’s previous books because I’m not as much of a fan of YA fantasy or science fiction as I used to be, but if she comes out with any more historical fiction (or even contemporary fiction) I will definitely check it out. Clearly she does her research, and the way she managed to bring the characters in this book – particularly Lily – to life speaks to her writing abilities.As a final note and a slight spoiler, for other LGBT readers who have been burned before by LGBT historical fiction, I assure you that neither Lily nor her girlfriend Kath die in the end, neither of them end up in an institution, neither of them “turn straight,” and in fact the ending, though somewhat open-ended, is mostly optimistic and happy.  1.5 ⭐Even though there were moments that were absolutely precious, I found this book really boring to be quite honest. . . 😶All the side characters got on my nerves (Shirley especially) and at times they all seems to blend in the same kind of person. All the queers were the same, all the chinese were the same and all her family were also the same. Same personality, same way of speaking and dressing, almost the same background. Also I don't understand the need to put the flashback chapters in the middle of the story. It completely threw me off from the plot because when the story got interesting, Malinda Lo decided to put a random chapter about someone from Lily's family in the middle of it for no other reason than to kinda know that certain person in a certain year... Overall, I wish the plot was more developed and less stoic and it would be way more interesting that instead of those random chapters or Lily's boring day to day life we got to see things from Kath's perspective. Even though I appreciate the rep and all the research that the author clearly did to make this book true, I didn't enjoy my time reading it. 😭  Content warnings:gay club raid, homophobia, racism, exotification, use of the n-word as a descriptor I loved this book so so much.It was so tentative and gentle but simultaneously rough to read at times and heartbreaking. It not only tackles what it was like to be an Asian queer woman (lesbian) in the 50s, but it also tackles the issues the Chinese community faces back then, head on. So it's a pretty well rounded story. I loved the way Lili and Kath's relationship was explored, as well as Lili's relationship with her queerness. How she was so oblivious to it, or tried to be, for so long that she only faced it once it came bubbling up. How even though she had feelings for a girl, when to an underground gay club that made her FEEL things she still tried to persuade herself out of it. But once she faced it and embraced it, there was no going back and no way for her to shove it back. Nor did she want to.  
  “Haven’t you ever wondered what it would be like to have nothing keeping you attached to the ground?”
Last Night at the Telegraph Club is a wonderful, heartfelt historical novel that deals with intersectionality, discovering one’s identity, and first love.I love slow burn romance, but I always forget how much I love slow burn when it comes to other aspects of storytelling like friendships and self discovery. Lo includes so many layers in this book, it’s impossible to not feel seen. The intersection of race, gender, and sexuality is as crucial to this story as the historical backdrop against which the story is set. Being from the Bay Area, I felt at home in the atmosphere in this book and the way Lily faced and overcame some hardships made her character easily likable. I think the main thing that stuck out about this book was just how much heart was put into it. The family dynamics felt so real, it was devastating at times, and I cannot even begin to explain the incredible impact that the tension between Lily and her family had on the mood of the book. What Lily felt, I felt, and as a reader, that is what is most important to me. I don’t have to relate to a character, but I want to be able to understand them and their actions. This was easy with Lily.The relationship between Lily and Kath was the highlight of the book for me. Their development was perfectly paced and their connection went beyond chemistry and entered the realm of necessity. It wasn’t just that they wanted to be together because they liked each other, but it was that they needed each other to fully experience all that life has to offer. The political and racial elements of this book only strengthened this idea and enforced the importance of intersectionality.With the political undertones and the racial themes in this book, every plot twist provided adequate tension between the right characters and necessary strain on their motivations and actions. While the story was difficult to digest at times because of some of its content, it all felt necessary and only added to the vibrant atmosphere of the book.This book radiates queer positivity that many people deserve to read about.  This book is very similar to "Tipping the Velvet," the debut novel by Sarah Waters. But instead of being set in Victorian England, "Last Night at the Telegraph Club" is set in San Francisco in the 1950s.Both novels focus on forbidden love in the world of lesbian bars and male impersonators. "Last Night at the Telegraph Club" deals with the additional problem of racism. The main character, Lily Hu, lives in conservative Chinatown and is of Chinese descent.The best part of this novel is the detailed portrait of the time period in postwar San Francisco, which was very carefully researched and faithfully executed. Malinda Lo's attention to detail is excellent in this regard. The main problem is the plot involving the Telegraph Club, the smoke-filled bar where the main draw for entertainment is male impersonation, i.e., where a female actress dresses and performs as a male singer/entertainer. I honestly don't understand the obsession (literally obsession) with male impersonation in both "Tipping the Velvet" and "Last Night at the Telegraph Club." Gender-swapped theater goes back to Shakespeare's time. Why is this so fascinating? The obsession with male impersonation is quite over-the-top and all-consuming for the characters in both books. Anyway, to continue with my point: it's not very believable that the main character, Lily, would want to keep going back to The Telegraph Club, where everyone is always so racist toward her. The people in the Telegraph Club only seem to care about smoking, drinking, partying, and lowbrow entertainment. Yet somehow Lily keeps finding herself drawn back to this place where people treat her so badly, launching racial slurs at her. It is just not believable to me. But apparently it was necessary for Lily to keep coming back to the Telegraph Club for the author to advance her overarching plot line, leading to its tragic finale. Overall this is a good book, especially the well-researched setting. But parts of the plot seem either too forced or too unoriginal in light of "Tipping the Velvet."  this is such a beautiful, lovingly written story of a chinese-american lesbian teenager discovering her sexuality and finding love in the 50s. the author manages to draw together different threads of history - the lives of chinese-american citizens in the wake of world war II, the queer community in 1950s san francisco - and wraps them up into an intimate story of a young girl trying to find herself amongst two fraught, marginalized communities in an era that was dangerous for both. i felt so much for lily and kath's innocent, burgeoning relationship and i love how, despite everything, they managed to carve a place for themselves and have hope for the future.  I loved this book so much!! RTC.Happy Pride Month! In honor of Pride Month, I plan to only read books that have LGBTQ+ representation this month.

Good, enjoyed it a lot and was just nice to read something else, felt like stepping out to San Francisco for a break. It’s worth remembering that it’s so easy to only read things by straight white people, and that doing otherwise *does* take an active effort. The writing is good but it felt like it should have been edited one more time. There were some story events that were set up but never went anywhere. A slow burn in some ways, but I felt like the sorry beats where in the wrong places. i.e. the raid felt more like a mid point and then the shame was that the last 100 pages were really excellent but then it was over?That said I still think this is worth reading. I read this because it was wlw and that still just hit different. I really enjoyed it for that and for Lily’s experience as a third culture kid, as a Chinese American.Lots of you know I’m not mad on YA Romance so I can happily report this ISNT one. It’s not a fluffy wlw rom com and it’s not a deeply tragic story about grieving lovers kept apart. It lives somewhere a little closer to the more personally defeated but perpetually hopeful. I do think it deserves its little spot in the queer canon, especially as something so recent. I was utterly absorbed in Malinda Lo’s YA novel, partly inspired by her family’s past it also draws on a wealth of research into 1950s lesbian life. Set in San Francisco in 1954, it features an extremely vivid reimagining of the city’s thriving, lesbian subculture seen through the eyes of Chinese American teenager Lily Hu. Lily lives with her family in Chinatown, a safe haven for Chinese Americans, already battling racism and unthinking stereotypes, now they’re the targets of America’s latest ‘red scare’ and the FBI’s ruthless quest for possible Communist sympathisers. It seems everyone around Lily’s telling her not to stand out, even the clothes her mother buys her are designed to make her inconspicuous, but at night she risks everything to sneak out to the Telegraph Club where she’s welcomed into a vastly different but equally tight-knit community of women. Lo’s book’s not likely to win any literary prizes, there are no instances of flashy prose or experiments with narrative form here, instead Lo gives her readers an exceptionally well-crafted, accessible, solidly-told piece; a rich and meticulous recreation of lost histories and a sensitive variation on the standard coming-out story. As someone who spends far too much time puzzling over which aspects of historical novels are based on fact and which complete fabrication, I particularly appreciated Lo’s detailed afterword outlining the actual historical background to Lily’s story, and Lo’s approach to its construction.  I absolutely loved this book so much. The lesbian representation along with the representation of the experience of immigrants and Chinese-Americans was so important. The writing was so well done that I was just pulled right into the story which made the characters feel so real. It was heartbreakingly beautiful in so many ways that it left me tearing up throughout the whole time I was reading it. Malinda Lo wrote an impactful coming-of-age story of the intersections of race, sexuality and immigration, that has definitely left a lasting impact on me. I don't know what else to say about this book that hasn't already been said by others but I'm so glad that I read this book and I can't wait to come back to it and read it all over again.  I knew I was going to love this book right from the dedication:"For all the butches and femmes, past, present, and future."Last Night at the Telegraph Club began pulling at my heartstrings before it even started, and didn't stop until the last page. I don't know what it is about young adult books that makes me so sentimental lately, but it seems like the older I get, the deeper I feel for the troubled kids at the center of these stories. Somehow, I just can't ignore the fact that I'm reading about vulnerable teens experiencing the kind of trauma and danger children should never go through.In this case, in particular, I couldn't help but be torn between excitement and fear as Lily, our main character, discovered her sexuality and fell in love for the first time. Malinda Lo did an excellent job portraying how difficult it was to be a woman, especially a queer woman, in 1950s Chinatown. Throughout the book, a sense of danger hovered over Lily and her loved ones: I was constantly expecting something awful to happen, which made the many lighthearted moments all the more bittersweet.I love historical fiction focusing on diaspora communities, and this delivered everything I wanted from it: the setting was vibrant and immersive, incredibly well researched as well as historically accurate; the characters felt three-dimensional and true to life; and the plot incorporated its main themes into the story in a seamless, effortless way. It was easy for me to empathize with Lily's struggles, which will probably resonate with queer and minority ethnic readers. I also appreciated how her family history was explored through frequent flashbacks, helping us better understand where they came from.I will say, the one thing that made me slightly uncomfortable was how Lo dealt with Lily's coming out. I personally don't like it when authors try to imply that gay characters "must" come out to their family for the sake of honesty, even if it means putting themselves in harm's way. It's not dishonest to lie about your sexuality in order to avoid being marginalized or cast out, especially when you're young and subject to your homophobic parents' authority.Minor gripes aside, I found this to be a masterfully written novel that will appeal to both teen and adult audiences looking for an atmospheric, emotional story to lose themselves in.  4.5there are so many small moments in this book are so…perfectly encapsulates lesbianism. the feeling of lily being freer with the two butches walking in front of her, seeing a butch for the first time and everything just…clicking, that rush of emotions for the first girl you’ve ever loved and how you would give the world for her despite everything. it’s in the smaller moments that this book shines the most. the moments where lily is finding herself engulfed into the culture of butch-femme lesbianism is so incredibly relatable. hearing other lesbians talk so freely about who they are and their community and getting that “how shit, is this allowed?” thoughts. realizing that you’re not alone, that other women out there, random ones on the street, ones you run into everyday may feel just like you. it’s this almost magical feeling, opening a portal to this world you never knew existed and no matter how much society is trying to beat you down, you want to stay in this world so badly. the author really captures so many other lesbian girlhood moments in a way i really haven’t seen in other books. when lily feels like she’s intruding just by being in the changing room with her straight girl friends despite not having feelings for her, your mother being the one that breaks you heart first, etc. there are so many books and viral posts talking about girlhood and it’s always through this heteronormative lens that i find myself isolated from but THIS IS IT. this captures me and my experience of lesbianism so well. even down to the unwilling but feeling like you must coming out moment and the painful silence that follows the coming out (like seriously, it’s like this author is inside my head stealing my memories)the only reason this isn’t a solid five stars is because:1) i feel like the whole red scare plot went nowhere2) i didn’t care for the flashback scenes at all. 3) the ending was a lil meh. but overall, i’m straight up gagged. so happy i bought this physically too so i can have my tears staining the paper as a special reminder &lt;3   I highly recommend listening to this book on audiobook to get a full appreciation for the Mandarin and Cantonese dialects incorporated into the story.This was a slow build up of a beautifully written story of self exploration and the intersection of multiple identities in the 1950s. Lily is a Chinese-American girl finishing up high school, figuring out that she's a lesbian through meeting other secretly queer people and visiting illegal gay clubs with her first crush.This historical fiction novel has a hopeful yet realistic ending as opposed to the happily ever after you wish for Lily. I was particularly thankful for acknowledging racist microaggressions that can and do occur within predominantly white and queer spaces in showing marginalization within marginalized spaces.CW: dated language surrounding race, racism, homophobia, xenophobia  Highly recommended. Lo takes us to 1950s Chinatown in San Francisco, where a teenage girl grapples with the expectations of immigrant parents, racism, anti-queer sentiment, and the awkwardness of first love. #LGBTQ BRILHANTE!!!!!Primeiro romance YA LGBTQ+ com protagonismo feminino a vencer o National Book Award, "Last Night at the Telegraph Club" merece todos os elogios! Essa é uma ficção histórica sobre uma garota chinesa-americana descobrindo o que significa ser não branca e lésbica na São Francisco da década de 1950 enquanto se apaixona por uma amiga do colégio. A escrita da Malinda Lo é linda, e conseguiu me cativar desde o início. O livro entregou o que exatamente o que eu esperava, e ainda surpreendeu: a base bibliográfica e história é sensacional!“That book. It was about two women, and they fell in love with each other.” And then Lily asked the question that had taken root in her, that was even now unfurling its leaves and demanding to be shown the sun: “Have you ever heard of such a thing?”O ritmo lento dessa história nos apresenta com calma as pulp fictions com protagonismo lésbico que bombavam na época, os clubes noturnos, as Male impersonators (o que seria chamado de Drag King hoje), as mudanças de linguagem, o crescente anticomunismo dos Estados Unidos, os esforços feitos pelos chineses para provar que podiam ser Verdadeiros Cidadãos Americanos, as nuances das experiências de pessoas queer não brancas, as noções de gênero e sexualidade... Muita coisa! O trabalho de pesquisa da autora certamente é um dos motivos para esse livro se destacar de todos os outros.“Are you like the girls in the book too? Because I think I am.”Acompanhei a história de Lily e Kath com um sorriso no rosto. O período era muito mais difícil do que hoje, então torci a cada segundo pelo final feliz das duas. Esse livro é sensacional! Vale a leitura.  I enjoyed this but it felt very long?? I don't know if that's the word to use but I got bored towards the middle waiting for something to happen. So this ended up taking me 11 days to read, which isn't 'bad' but I normally can finish a book way faster. I still loved this a lot though. I think I may just be too harsh 😅😅  I've read many good reviews of this book, so, yassssssss asian sapphics u will always be ( unbelievably and gut wrenchingly traumatized ) BUT FAMOUS NONETHELESS ‼️‼️ Ugh it's been a hot minute since a book destroyed me this much. Since I started reading primarily queer fiction, period pieces and historical fiction have never been my favorite genre, but recently I found that changing. But that change is primarily just with 20th century period pieces. I've found myself really enjoying them. And this is one of the best since then. This book follows Lily Hu, a Chinese American 17 year old girl living in Chinatown in San Francisco in 1954. One day she finds an ad for a nightclub advertising "male impersonators" and she is completely drawn in by this concept. When she inadvertently reveals the ad to another student at her school, Kathleen "Kath" Miller, only to find Kath has been there before, they decide to visit together. And that visit opens a whole new world of possibilities to them both. This book is so great. It's powerful, emotional, and so real. Lo's descriptive writing made San Francisco in 1954 feel so alive I yearned to see it and be a part of what was going on there. I particularly loved the writing in how she described the scene where Lily and Kath visited the club for the first time. It reminded me viscerally of when I was brought to a drag show for the first time when I was 20 and figuring out my identity.I adore Lily. She is so strong, smart and wonderful. Wanting to make her place in the world when most doors were still closed to people like her. She deserves everything in life. And I love how open she was to learning and new experiences. You can tell she is often afraid, but she never lets it hold her back from going after what she wants. and ugh her relationship with Kath was so perfect. It was the perfect balance of figuring out their feelings, being afraid to express them, but feeling everything so strongly you eventually can't hold back. They were so wonderful together. Kath was so great too! I know this is a book primarily about Lily but I wanted more Kath! This book made me so angry too. Not at the book itself, but just how it depicted in such stark realism the racist and homophobic world that existed in the 1950s. The influence of the red and lavender scares to all aspects of society was so strong. It's a reminder of how far as a queer community we have come in a relatively short amount of time. Don't get me wrong, we still have a ways to go- I'm trans I have no delusions that the work for equality is finished, but the fact that it is so very recent in history that queerness has any kind of wide public support on any level is amazing. This book perfectly depicts the nostalgia for a lot time in queer history while showing how dark and brutal it often was at the same time. There is a lot of history given here, especially about Chinese and Asian experiences in America- and as a white person I can't speak about them firsthand at all but I did really appreciate learning about many important figures and events. I had absolutely no idea who Qian Xiesen was and how he was treated by the government. This book did have some interesting time jumps and flashbacks into the lives of other characters, and I understand how they give context to the story- especially what it was like to be Chinese American in the early 20th Century, but it was a little jarring at times when I just wanted to know more about what was happening with Lily and Kath. I loved this book. It destroyed me in the best ways And I don't know why I waited this long to read it! 5/5  such a wonderfully written book that made me rejoice Lily and Kath's love but also shed tears at the reality of their lives. I'm in awe of the research went into this to portray the Asian American and queer experience in 1950s. The writing imagines Chinatown in the most vivid manner (the streets, the vibes, the food the lives of people) almost as if I was living in that time. And I just love how Lily and Kath existed in their own little bubble of discovering their sexuality and love for each other, stealing kisses, noticing each other, secretly spending time together. Heart full of love for this book and the ray of joy and hope it provides despite everything.  Rep: Chinese American lesbian mc, lesbian li, Chinese and Chinese American side characters, lesbian side charactersCWs: period typical racism, homophobia and lesbophobia as an 18 year old who lives in the bay area who is also chinese-american, i obviously saw a lot of myself in this book. you can just tell how much research and love was spent on this. i saw my asian american identity in the way the author depicted the lunar new year, the complexities and community within chinatown. the way san francisco was described was with such fine detail, it was kinda like i was witnessing a whole new SF despite living here my entire life. but even if i wasn’t those things at all, this book is utterly phenomenal. still wanna touch on the setting tho. usually, people who write about san francisco just write about it as a whole. not this one. this story made san francisco the world. from coit tower, to ocean beach, the presidio... i’ve never seen san francisco written so detailed before! maybe it’s my SF pride and maybe i am biased, but it’s just SO good.but if the world building isn’t enough, the story between kath and lily was just so, so beautiful. i was just living vicariously through them! the romance and slow burn between them was painful, exciting, and beautiful to watch. simply because their love wasn’t tolerated at that time, they were punished because of it and that’s what makes their romance so gripping. also, as lily comes to terms with her identity, you can see herself become squashed by the societal norms at the time and it just :(( ugh okay so if the world building and romance isn’t enough, the writing is... wow. breathtaking. i saw everything SO vividly through the writing. okay, here’s an example: “She felt as if she were sinking back into her seat, falling into the gravity well of the earth. And then, as the stars above her moved, depicting their nightly journey across the cosmos, she felt as if she were moving with them. Her stomach lurched and she had to close her eyes for a moment against the motion, but the allure of the vision was too strong, and she opened them again and marveled at the sensation that gripped her. There was no up; there was no down. She was floating, suspended between earth and sky.”JUST!! WOW!!! it can get a little dense and wordy sometimes &amp; i know that it’s not everyones cup of tea but i enjoyed it! lastly, books trying to jam pack too many storylines just end up feeling rushed and incomplete. like this one deals with the cold war, lgbtq+ rep in the 1950s, asian american identity, and a whole romance. however, i found the differing POV’s, intensive research the author did, and literal timelines helpful in really gathering a sense of what the cold war was like for asian americans/lgbtq+ community. i’m so glad i found malinda lo. i truly believe she’s an up and coming author with a really bright future ahead of her, after a release as amazing as this. and i’m so excited to watch her grow. i really can’t wait for her other works to come out! this story is SEVERELY underrated as it is and it always fills me with pride seeing asian authors pioneer in storytelling like this. please please PLEASE read this. might need to place this #1 in my favorite books ive read in 2021!  This novel follows Lily Hu, a Chinese American girl growing up in San Francisco’s Chinatown as she slowly discovers her attraction to women and is able to explore her feelings and find love. This book seems to sell itself as a love story, but to me it really felt more about Lily herself then her relationship with Kath. I feel like it thinks that about itself as well since the relationship doesn’t turn romantic for a very long time into the story and they are together for only such a small segment of the book. It felt like a tale of first love if not forever love, and that the journey was way more important to Lily than the actual person, which works since Kath seemed to be one of the weaker characters of the story. We really get into daily life and emotional journey of Lily. I think this is because I am such a plot driven person that I felt this was a little slow. But there are so many amazing quiet and powerful moments that Lily experiences that it makes it so worth it. I loved hearing about a time and culture I really knew very little about, which includes both Chinatown and the gay scene of the 1950s. I would be very interested to hear what someone who is from or has lived in San Francisco thinks of this novel as it seemed to have so many details and descriptions of the city itself. The story seemed cleaved into two parts reflecting how Lily tried to separate the two parts of her life so completely. Her Asian culture, family and friends kept away from her new gay friends, making it feel almost disjointed in a purposeful way like Lily’s own feelings. The story really ‘picks up’ in the last 100 pages with a lot of dramatic action happening. It was very emotionally impactful and upsetting. The epilogue of course gives us a ‘happy ending’ but knowing that Lily situation hasn’t really changed and neither has the world then I am not sure it entirely felt that way for me. Overall, a lovely character journey about finding yourself in a difficult time and against cultural expectations with bonus love story and historical significance.  ʟᴀꜱᴛ ɴɪɢʜᴛ ᴀᴛ ᴛʜᴇ ᴛᴇʟᴇɢʀᴀᴘʜ ᴄʟᴜʙ is a beautifully written historical romance of two teenage women navigating their sexuality in the 1950s. As a Chinese woman living in America, Lily Hu and her family live under the threat of being accused as a communist. From there, she struggles between freely expressing her sexuality without tarnishing the family name. “ꜱʜᴇ’ꜱ ʜᴀᴠɪɴɢ ᴀ ʜᴀʀᴅ ᴛɪᴍᴇ ʀɪɢʜᴛ ɴᴏᴡ ʙᴇᴄᴀᴜꜱᴇ ʏᴏᴜ’ʀᴇ ɴᴏᴛ ᴡʜᴀᴛ ꜱʜᴇ ᴇxᴘᴇᴄᴛᴇᴅ. ʙᴜᴛ ᴡᴇ’ʀᴇ ɴᴇᴠᴇʀ ᴡʜᴀᴛ ᴏᴜʀ ᴘᴀʀᴇɴᴛꜱ ᴇxᴘᴇᴄᴛᴇᴅ. ᴛʜᴇʏ ʜᴀᴠᴇ ᴛᴏ ʟᴇᴀʀɴ ᴛʜᴀᴛ ʟᴇꜱꜱᴏɴ.” (4.5/5)I deeply appreciate all the historical research that was put into the novel. Malinda Lo did an excellent job in adapting the storyline from actual queer culture and history. The book was also written so vividly, I myself felt like I was watching a performance at the Telegraph club. The romance between Lily and Kath is a wonderful portrayal of discovering your identity and coming to terms with your sexuality. While homosexuality in this setting was undeniably considered a crime, everything about their relationship screamed innocence. Everything was new, every touch, every feeling, and the way they shyly then wholly accepted one another gives a beautiful representation of loving a woman at such a time. Lily as a character felt awfully real, the shame that she feels for loving Kath, accepting the way she is, and dealing with parental disappointment. The way her parents reacted felt so real, a type of disappointment that is ultimately tied with love but unacceptance. Nonetheless, Malinda Lo did not fail to portray the mundane reality that is faced by the queer community. Despite the slow start of the novel, I think everyone should read this at least once in their lives.  
  Review originally published June 18, 2021
 Malinda Lo's Last Night at the Telegraph Club is a thoroughly researched and well imagined dive into history and first love. Encompassing her research of minority women working in aviation with 1950s queer history, Lo has crafted a tale full of historical context while also portraying the budding love and coming out story of its main character, Lily Hu.I really enjoyed the unique style in which the author crafted the story. The chapter breaks include some timelines about what was happening in the world in terms of Chinese American legislation, McCarthyism, and in the events of the Hu family's life. Flashback scenes by Lily's family members give the reader a firsthand look at immigrant life during a time where deportation threats, government allegiance, and the rise of the "Joneses" perfect image plagued the nation. Lily is faced with dire consequences over who she hangs out with and who she is. While the consequences are severe, you can't help but root for Lily every step of the way to explore and accept who she is and embrace the power of first love. This book is a wonderful historical fiction novel with queer main characters. While published as YA, it is easily an enjoyable adult crossover read. It'll remind you what it feels like to be kissed by someone you've just fallen head over heels for.-Jess, Youth ServicesFind this book and other titles within our catalog.  i wanna start by saying the truth: im not a fan of malinda lo's writing, ive been trying to read and finish one book of her for ages now but i....just can't! there's really someything about the way she writes that makes me feel down even if it's joyous or happy...this being told, i finally finished one of her books. yeah!this book saved me of malinda lo's curse, and it's means this book is a blessing! not only because of it, but the power the things written here holds are spectacular and bigger than prejudice or hate, i felt so much happiness and proud, i truly loved reading it! and i hope this book achieves even more people, so they feel that ginormous feeling!   i'm speechless. rtc. this book reminds me of everything everywhere all at once🫶 i read this book in nyc.  
  ”rockets to the moon didn’t seem so far-fetched when kath listened to her. she made previously unimaginable things seem possible.”
for me, there’s something so special about reading queer characters in historical fiction. a feeling that i can’t seem to put into words. one of feeling visible, feeling connected. feeling known, feeling recognized. feeling that i’m part of something so big, something that’s always been there. because queer people have always existed. even when we were told not to. even when we had to hide. we have always been here.there is still persecution. there is still discrimination. there is still hiding. but we persist and we fight and we exist.but (possibly just due to the books i’ve chosen to pick up) a lot of the queer historical fiction i’ve read has been about white cis gay men.and then—last night at the telegraph club is about lily hu. about san francisco in 1954. about being 17 and the child of chinese immigrants. about discovering the lesbian nightclub scene with a girl who’s been there the whole time without you seeing her. about finding your place in these nightclubs, and being afraid of what that means. about falling in love when it’s dangerous to.my whole existence, is intersectional. i am queer, a woman, an asian-american. in telegraph club, this experience is reflected back at me, but distorted like a funhouse mirror—where the world is different, time turned back. there are ways i am safer. there are ways i am still in danger. the world has changed so much. we have come so far. but there’s still so much discrimination and pain for every facet of my identity. we still have some ways to go.one day our stories will be seen as historical. i hope for the future queer asian-american girls, the world is even brighter.malinda lo has crafted a love story. between two girls, yes, but also a love story to the queer women who came before us. a love story to asian immigrant parents who wanted to protect their children. a love story to the a past that is dangerous. a love story to the intersection of these things. when i closed this book, i wanted to break into sobs. i’m thankful for this love story to be told.  I loved every minute of this historical YA about Chinese-American Lily falling for white Kath during the 1950s in San Francisco. It's an era of change and upheaval, and an era where the Red Scare still emerges to put those who are "other" into their places. Told in a few timelines, this family story is about immigration post-Chinese Exclusion, about the realities of being called a Communist, and about the ways in which living up to parental and cultural expectations in a changing world means putting your true self in the dark. The inclusion of the Telegraph Club, a lesbian nightclub, was unique and the ways Lily and Kath build a found family through it are so powerful. Don't skip the author's note in this one. It's packed with historical context adding even more depth to the impressive story. Lo knocks it out of the park with her historical novel and once again, I'm so thrilled to see more and more girls of color giving the chance to star in historical fiction.   Cosa significa essere una giovane lesbica di origine asiatica nella San Francisco degli anni 50, in pieno maccartismo e caccia alle streghe rosse? Nonostante l’urgenza politica e la drammaticità del tema – che mescola razzismo, sessismo e integrazione forzata – il libro è leggero, una vitale ricostruzione della giovinezza e della trasgressione, che mette al centro l’emersione del desiderio e la scoperta della propria sessualità. Pulsante, tenero e seducente, benché probabilmente troppo lento.   Printz Honor 2022Malinda Lo's writing didn't work for me 12 years ago when Ash came out, and it still doesn't now. No third try for me.  Last Night at the Telegraph Club is a vibrant and heartfelt sapphic historical fiction novel that follows Lily Hu who stumbles upon an advert for a male impersonator in a newspaper and her curiosity gets the better of her. When a classmate, Kathleen Miller, picks up the dropped newspaper cut-out, Kathleen reveals to her that she has been to the impersonator’s show before and Lily, excited to find someone to share this excitement with, asks her to take her along. The two visit the Telegraph Club – a lesbian bar – under the cloak of moonlight and a whole new world is opened up to Lily. However, in 1950s San Francisco, homophobia is not the only thing that Lily has to look out for – her father is under suspicion of treating a communist who visits his Chinese doctors’ surgery, and Lily’s relationship with her best friend is on the rocks. But when Lily starts slowly falling in love with another girl, it feels like the most right thing in the world.This was my first foray into Malinda Lo’s works, though I recently purchased a second hand copy of Ash on Depop, and I’m so happy to say that I adored this novel! Though I absolutely adore the genre, I don’t tend to read a lot of historical fiction, particularly historical fiction set during the Red Scare. This is a part of history that, admittedly, I don’t know all that much about, especially since it wasn’t as big a phenomenon in Scotland, so it was really interesting to get an insight into this period in time, and it’s one that I’ll definitely be educating myself more on.As for Lily as a character, I loved reading from her perspective. Her character growth throughout the novel was so heartening to see – from almost cowering in response to her best friend’s overpowering, headstrong nature to standing up for herself as the novel neared its close, as well as refusing to lie about her true self was both heart-breaking and so powerful to see! I thought that the inclusion of both Cantonese and Mandarin, as well as many aspects of Chinese culture, sprinkled throughout the book made the story even richer, and Malinda Lo’s author’s note at the end of the book, explaining her choices regarding italicisation, the use of traditional vs. simplified characters, and ‘Chinglish’ was such an interesting addition as I love seeing the thought process that goes into an author’s work (and my mouth was also watering at the food descriptions)! Kath was another wonderful character – I loved how her love for flying planes complimented Lily’s interest in space and they really felt perfect for each other. Something that was mentioned in our book club discussion was when Kath is referred to as a baby butch by older lesbians and the joy that that brings her, and that really just made my heart so happy! Alongside the dedication to femmes and butches and the start of the book, it made me so excited to see that so many young sapphics are going to have this beautiful, positive butch representation in their lives!The lesbian bar scene and Tommy, the male impersonator, reminded me a lot of Tipping the Velvet by Sarah Waters and Masquerade by Anne Shade, and it really solidified my love for this part of queer history in literature. The almost found family that Lily finds in the bar was so heartening to see, even though it was marred by the racist microaggressions that she faced – Lily’s Chinese ethnicity is something that is intrinsically woven into her experiences in the queer bar life, and it is a perspective that I feel was sorely needed in YA literature. As I am not an own voices reader for Asian representation, I highly recommend that you check out Hsinju’s review for the book – not only is it a wonderful, in depth review, but they also go more in depth into parts of the book that are completely unknown to me, including the space-y aspects!Overall, this was such a wonderful novel that left me tearing up whenever I thought about it, hours after I’d put the book down! This is a book that is sure to stay with me for a long time and I can’t wait to read more by Malinda Lo in the future!  CW: homophobia, racism, sexism, outdated/offensive racial and social epithets (typical of time period but definitely uncomfortable), threats of deportation, miscarriage, coming outThis book is both so unapologetically queer and unapologetically Chinese American, and I loved that about it. I really don't read much historical fiction, especially not YA historical romance (I genuinely can't think of another one I've read) so I'm really not sure how to review this one. I think "enjoy" isn't quite the word I'd use for it - in all honesty, this was a really tough read for me. Although this takes place in the 1950s and society was far less open-minded than it is today, I related to Lily on so many different levels, and it all hit a little too close to home for me. Her struggles with the intersectionality of her queerness and her race and culture were so relatable to me, and parts of this story really broke my heart. What I love most about Lily (and this book) is how resilient and strong she is as a character. Even in the face of all these struggles and trying to balance a world and a society that hates her for being gay and Chinese, she manages to find a way to find love in every sense of the word. This book explores familial love, platonic love, romantic love, and most importantly, self love, and overall had such a hopeful tone to it despite discussing such tough issues.I think my main gripe with this book is honestly that I think it tried to do a bit too much? But I also don't know what Malinda Lo could've cut out either, so I'm not really sure. It definitely did feel a bit scattered at times, though, so I do wish the plotlines could've been tightened up a bit. One thing I really loved were the flashbacks - I feel like they gave a really good insight into Lily's family, and tells us a bit about her upbringing and her family's values. Family is such an important part of Chinese culture, and I really loved the emphasis on this in the book.Reading this during a time where there's so much hate towards the Asian American community definitely feels weird. On one hand, we've definitely come a long way, but at the same time, we really haven't, and that's really just so depressing for me personally. So do keep that in mind when you read it, especially if you're Chinese American, as it could be quite triggering. Overall, I would 100% recommend this book for fans of historical romance. I loved the lesbian found family vibes, the culture, and the historical elements. You can really tell Malinda Lo put in a lot of research into this book, and it paid off. I will definitely be checking out more of her writing for sure!  An excellent YA historical fiction novel set in San Francisco's Chinatown in the 1950s. The main character, Lily, is a teenager interested in science and space travel.I appreciated that the book felt well-researched and historically accurate. (The Author's Note at the end is nine pages organized into topics such as the 1950s, Language, Chinatown, and Lesbians and Gender — plus another two pages for a bibliography.)The book for me dragged in places when the story shifted away from Lily and into the backstories of various family members. Sometimes this felt didactic, intended to teach the YA readers a bit of history. These digressions interfered with the plot momentum, and made the book feel too long.However, many people do unreservedly love this book, and for good reason. 4.5 stars rounded down because I've not yet had coffee.

I really do. i guess I just couldn't get myself through this one. One day, I;ll read this. but for now it's so long and farewell  I’ve been a big fan of this author since I read Ash years ago so I had this book on my tbr for a long time. Rave reviews and important awards are great to see but the story seemed like a good fit for me so I waited for the right time. It’s 1954, San Francisco and everything is about to change for Lily Hu. Up until her senior year, life has marched on, her circle of friends the same since forever, using her own words, her actions always those of a good Chinese daughter. But when she spots a photo of a male impersonator in a newspaper article, a window opens inside of her. I remember my own moment and it’s so specific and so compelling a feeling that it’s almost impossible not to follow. Lily does just that and connects with a girl at school named Kathleen Miller. They become friends and more. Here’s what I love about the book, the view of night life in 1954 from the pov of a teenager on the brink of adulthood, the ache of being caught between two worlds, the awe in Lily when she begins to step into her own future, the headiness of first love. The author tells Lily’s story in the maturing voice of someone who is no longer a child but still caught at home under parents’ rules. Oftentimes, ya books have a younger perspective but I felt the weight of an emerging woman’s viewpoint which added to the potency. Although the story has painful scenes, the author is protective of her characters and the reader. She does a masterful job of pulling the narrative together to give us a truthful and satisfying ending. The audiobook is voiced perfectly.   DNF after like 149 pages. Daaamn it was boring I had to force myself to read this one ngl. Not to mention when I finally picked it up every page was so dreaded, I was reading and flipping them pages but I felt like I was going nowhere. Essentially up until page 149 this book was just about everything and nothing. Meaning that most of descriptions and details where a lot of the times unnecessary and too descriptive since it was descriptions about very mundane things. And I still don't see how the flashback chapters were supposed to add anything to the story? However I still think this book is somewhat meaningful and important. As it shows how it is/was to live as a Chinese American in the 1950s and also how the LGBTQ+ community was viewed back then and how it was to try and figure out and explore your sexuality when it crashed against both the social and cultural norms they had back in the 1950s. Still sadly tho the book in itself was just very boring.   Dość nietypowa jak na młodzieżówkę, bo wydaje się bardzo długa i rozciągnięta, a jednocześnie pozbawiona akcji i pogłębienia charakterów postaci. Mógłbym narzekać na kilka elementów, ale jako całość książka mi się podobała, głównie ze względów czysto rozrywkowych. Ciekawy pomysł z osadzeniem fabuły w San Francisco lat 50. i niesamowity, w sumie dość rzadko spotykany klimat.  (4.5/5)this. was. so. good.everything about this book is so well-developed, from the historical background to the interdisciplinary struggles that the main character, lily, undergoes through the course of the book. on top of that, everything that happens in this book flows so fucking well and the build-up is absolutely exquisite.everything that lily felt and experienced seemed so genuine and realistic to me as i was reading this book. her struggle to first understand herself and to come to terms with her sexuality which developed into a conflict between her true identity and the identity expected of her which ultimately fed into her desire to remain true to herself felt so incredibly real, so personal, and it's really the crux of what makes this book so compulsively readable. it isn't just a story of a girl navigating her sexuality but much more than that; it's made of parts of journeys that we've all experienced.the writing style of this book definitely aided my perception of this book. it had a way of getting straight to the emotion of the matter, but it wasn't needlessly wordy or particularly clinical at the same time. it was a good balance and that, combined with short chapters, which i am always a fan of, made for a good reading experience.i loved the historical time period that this book was set in, and apart from it being apparent that the author clearly did their research on this time in history, it really added another layer to the story that was being told. there was so much that lily was dealing with, apart from putting to words her attraction to other women, but also of her race and her culture and how others viewed it, and the fact that she was a girl who wanted to enter a male-dominated field. this added to the ongoing commentary on societal norms and familial values that was present throughout the novel and gave it more context.the characters present were by and large quite charming. i loved the slow build-up to lily and kath's relationship, and the sweet way they fell in love and then fought for their relationship. the flashback chapters from lily's parents and her aunt felt a little out of place and irrelevant to the story at the beginning, but it soon became clear that those chapters were present for the sake of the social commentary that this book implied at.(except for shirley. i hated shirley. she was clearly an awful person who manipulated lily into being her yes-man and dropped her the moment she didn't act according to her script. also, i'm going to have to call bs on that scene where she gets mad at lily for keeping her relationship with kath a secret. like, hello??? miss girl was out here making out with a purported communist supporter in broad daylight and then had the audacity to attack lily over her secret relationship?? make it make sense; she was the most infuriating character because i KNOW people in real life who behave like her and make comments even when technically they can not be talking.as much flattery as i have for this book, however, the ending kind of let me down. to be quite honest, the few chapters leading up to the ending and the epilogue felt fairly rushed, especially the part where lily's parents and aunt decide that she's going to be sent away until the rumors die down, because it felt like it came out of nowhere. the epilogue especially felt unsatisfying to me after everything that happened in the story, because even though it felt optimistic, it was too vague for my liking.overall, i really enjoyed this book, and it made for a thought-provoking read. i liked it much more than i found it lacking, and it discussed a lot of serious topics without seeming heavy-handed or too boring—at the center of this story is a girl who falls in love, and it manages not to lose sight of that. i was expecting more from the ending, but holistically this book more than makes up for it, and i wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to someone who's looking for a good historical read.  I liked this book. I went into it blind so had no idea what to expect, but it ended up mostly living up to the hype I’ve seen of it online. It was well written and had a cast of quite interesting characters that I found myself caring about. I didn’t really care for the flashback aspect of the book, though it served a purpose I found it quite boring.I didn’t really know a lot about the historical context of the story exactly, but it did a really good job of explaining it. It touched on identity, race, sexuality and misogyny, but also went quite heavy with exploring deportation and communism a bit as well. It was quite a well rounded book and brought many factors into play I wasn't anticipating. The relationships here were really interesting, but I found myself drawn to the family dynamics. They were really interesting to navigate, and it added a lot of depth and emotion to the story.I also really loved how informative this felt at times. It had footnotes for all of the translations, I usually google them to understand the context but here it was just inserted into the book itself which was nice. There was also a lot of cool information about language, context and that time period for reference which was educational and interesting. It worked well to help you get a better understanding of the story.It was a great coming of age piece, and really captured the feeling of trying to figure yourself out and feeling out of place amongst people who seemingly have their lives together. Not your everyday YA novel but one that deserves all the love it has garnered.  This is genuinely the best coming-of-age story I’ve ever read!It was such a great experience. To quote the book itself, it made me feel a spark of recognition, or a glow of hope. I was smiling like crazy at every interaction the love interests had, it was so precious (I also cried like 20 times, but those were often tears of joy) I simply fell in love and can’t recommend it enough! I only wish it existed when I was a teenager myself  I don't think I can even put into words what this book meant to me. It managed to capture so many little bits about being sapphic and of being closeted and realizing/coming to terms with your sexuality and even though I'm not a lesbian, I felt so  seen . This book just exuded wlw culture and I adored it.  Eine bewegende Geschichte über die junge heimliche Liebe zweier Teenager in den 50er Jahren in San Francisco, die trotz gesellschaftlichem und politischem Druck erblüht.Die Geschichte wird überwiegend aus der Sicht von Lily Hu in den 50er Jahren erzählt, welche hin und her gerissen ist zwischen ihren Verpflichtungen der Familie gegenüber und dem was sie wirklich fühlt. Die Autorin geht hierbei insbesondere auf politische Probleme hinsichtlich der Nachwirkungen diverser Kriege (2. Weltkrieg, Koreakrieg), die Regierungen in China (Kommunisten auf dem Festland und Nationalisten auf Taiwan) und deren Auswirkung auf die in Amerika lebenden Chinesen und Eingewanderten ein. Auch Lily und ihre Familie spüren die Auswirkungen direkt und als Leser wird uns die bedrückende Stimmung sehr schnell bewusst.Dazu kommt noch der Aspekt der nicht öffentlich anerkannten Homosexualität, mit dem sich Lily und Kath auch beschäftigen müssen.Ab und zu gibt es einzelne Kapitel aus der Sicht von Lilys Eltern oder Tante, einige Jahre vor der "jetzigen" Zeitlinie, zusätzlich gibt es auch gelegentlich einen Zeitstrahl im Buch, welcher auch Weltereignisse widerspiegelt.Die Recherche der Autorin war in jedem Fall sehr tiefgründig und wird auch im Nachwort nochmals aufgegriffen. Das Ende hätte ich mir persönlich etwas länger erzählt gewünscht. Hier wurde mir der Ausgang etwas zu kurz abgehandelt und auch generell hätte ich einige Szenen gern länger beschrieben gesehen. An einigen Kapitelenden hatte ich das Gefühl die Handlung springt etwas zur neuen Szene, ohne den Rest "auszuerzählen".Dennoch hat mir die Geschichte sehr gut gefallen, insbesondere der sehr detaillierte Einblick in Lilys Leben, ihre Familie, deren Erwartungen und Lilys Gedankenwelt zu Allem. Daher gebe ich gerne 4 Sterne. ♥  3.9/5 stars! I think this book has so much to offer, in terms of identity, political agendas, young love and culture. The thing I think I enjoyed most was how Malinda Lo is able to show a world that is not black and white, that a lot of life is spent in that grey area.The story is told mostly from Lily’s perspective as she’s on this journey of self discovery. Not only as a teenage girl, but as a Asian American. An Asian American in the 50s, who is also trying to figure out her sexuality. This is quite difficult as Lily has no one to speak to about this, that is until she meets Kath (even though they’ve been in classes together for years).Lily and Kath’s relationship truly was the star of this story. Both girls are tip toeing around their feelings for one another, while also trying not to completely fall head over heels. These two share so many cute, subtle and flirty moments that cause giddiness and butterflies for the reader. I think their relationship was so well paced in terms of build up. At first, Lily seems like a naïve girl, who always follows the rules, and would never do anything to “embarrass” her family. However, Lily is so damn brave. She seems to be the one to take the first steps, she is the one who pushes for more, who becomes more daring, and she’s also the one who doesn’t want to hide who she is. Not only that, but she has big dreams and refuses to change these dreams, no matter what society says she “can’t” pursue as a career. The thing I didn’t appreciate about the book was the last 70 pages or so. Everything felt quite rushed. After such great paced writing for the rest of the book, the ending seemed overstuffed, while also left out plot development. So many things weren’t addressed, or only touched on slightly. No amends were made and it kind of skipped a lot of these big important moments.Overall though, I think this book was beautifully written and one worth reading. It tackles many serious issues, while also telling a story about the power of your first love. ***Something to note: harmful language (I understand it is within the context of the novel). Before reading, you may look at the Author’s Notes at the back of the book in which she speaks on this and other things!***  This book's perfection came out of left field and hit me like a truck. I AM IN LOVE! Hands-down my favorite read of 2021 so far. (RTC--maybe). Buddy read with Hsinju! New favourite book jak przerzuciłam ostatnią stronę i okazało się, że to już koniec to miałam takie: ale jak to koniec halo ja chcę więcej wydarzeń z rok później…. książka bardzo mi się spodobała i bardzo chętnie wróciłabym do niej ponownie🫡 3,5⭐️7/10Podobało mi się! Chociaż na pewno nie jest to książka dla osób, które nudzą się przy historiach bez akcji - bo tu ich nie znajdziecie. Wszystko idzie powolutku i bardziej skupiamy się na tych wszystkich emocjach towarzyszących bohaterkom, co jest ogromnym plusem tej książki, bo momenty gdzie Lily odkrywa czego tak naprawdę potrzebuje &gt;&gt;Jest tu romans wlw, a ich nie ma jakoś dużo, więc i’m happy ze takie książki powstają i jest ich coraz więcej.W tej tak jak mówiłam skupiamy się głównie na emocjach, odkrywaniu tożsamości i swoich własnych uczuć przez Lily. Klimat książki jest świetny, bo to ze dziewczyna boi sie przyznać nawet przed samą sobą co czuję powoduje chociażby czas i miejsce w którym żyje, San Francisco lata 50 gdzie obraz miasta jest przedstawiony jako nieakceptujący „odmienności” jak to zaznaczają. Ogromne plusy właśnie za klimat, za przedstawienie miejsca w jakim żyją bohaterki, za przedstawione problemy i ich odbieranie przez społeczność, politykę itp. Co się „powinno”, a nie chce. Chciałabym jednak jakoś bardziej rozbudowane to zakończenie, brakowało mi jak takiej truskawki na torcie, aleee jest bardzo oki!  This book filled a hole in my heart. I've read like, two queer historical fiction books, and I was very eager to get my hands on this. I also didn't know much about the 1950s in queer and lesbian history, so I knew I was going to love it. I also loved getting to learn about Chinese-American history and their experiences in the 1950s. I'm a big history nerd so I felt like I was gobbling up all the information that I could. And Lily, oh how I loved Lily. Her journey with her sexuality was so relatable and so beautifully portrayed. The way Lo described it, it was like I was experiencing it for the first time all over again. The budding, secret relationship between Kath and Lily made me ache so much, seeing how much they liked each other and seeing how restrained they had to be by the times. I also loved seeing the intersections of race and sexuality in the story and the experiences Lily had being both Chinese and gay. I cried my eyes out at the ending. I kind of knew what i was signing up for based off the premise, but I still bawled my eyes out. I'd also say that the ending was just deeply *satisfying.* I just walked away feeling content and seen and warm. 5/5 Stars, everybody has to read this book.  There was a lot to like about this book. I kind of went into in blind as a new release at the library and just dove into it.Lily is an enticing narrator and a likable character. There are many Chinese familial aspects and beliefs thrown in that I loved. Lily is figuring out who she is and where she fits into the world, on top of navigating historically unacceptable romantic preferences. I loved that things weren't sugar-coated and that it was an authentic look at historical trials and acceptances of lesbians in the California 50s. San Francisco and Chinatown acted as perfect backdrops for this discovery process.4 Stars for me.  Excellent YA historical sapphic romance. Loved Lily and Kath and the risks they were forced to take to be together in McCarthy era 1950's America. Heartfelt, endearing and heartbreaking coming of age tale I won't soon forget.  YA! Its a coming of age "coming out" tale--a Chinese American attempts living her truth--even if it is the 50s. America in that decade, plus global events, plus authentic San Fran locales--what is lacking? Nothing. Really enjoyable. *suspiro de colegiala* Digital audiobook performed by Emily Woo Zeller  From the book jacket Seventeen-year-old Lily Hu can’t remember exactly when the question took root, but the answer was in full bloom the moment she and Kathleen Miller walked under the flashing neon sign of a lesbian bar called the Telegraph Club. American in 1954 is not a safe place for two girls to fall in love, especially not in Chinatown. Red-Scare paranoia threatens everyone, including Chinese Americans like Lily and her family. My reactionI really liked this YA work of historical fiction that focuses on the Chinese-American experience during the McCarthy Red-Scare period. Lily is a fairly typical teen of the era, especially one growing up in an insular culture and a protective family. She is pretty naïve about relationships, but then she has focused her energies to this point on science and being a good student. When she meets Kathleen it’s through their school work, and Kathleen is cautious about approaching Lily in any romantic way. But Lily stumbles across a book that depicts a lesbian relationship and it puzzles her, though she is also intrigued and excited. And slowly she begins to realize that there is an entire community of women who share these feelings. Coming out in this time period was not easy and fraught with danger. Lily risked, at least, being ostracized by her family, and at worst being arrested and/or committed to an asylum to “cure her” of her “aberrant behavior.” Though she starts out naïve and unsure, she shows herself to be principled, compassionate, and willing to stand up for herself. I really appreciated the historical setting for this coming-out story. It provided Lo with an opportunity to educate her readers about the realities of this era, especially on Chinese and other Asian Americans. She also detailed how San Francisco, a city now famously welcoming and open to its LBGTQ residents, was not so long ago a dangerous place for gays. I liked how she included an historical timeline every few chapters, detailing not only what is happening with the characters in the book, but the actual events of the period. And I loved the Author’s Note at the end, in which Lo provided much more information about the history depicted in the novel. When you read this book, do NOT skip this section. The audiobook was narrated by Emily Woo Zeller who did a marvelous job. There are many female characters, and she was able to differentiate them sufficiently so I was never confused about who was speaking.  Alright I’m gonna write this review now before I forget everything that happened in this (which wasn’t a lot). This book started off very promising. I enjoyed the writing style, I enjoyed the main character. I liked the idea of her struggling to come to terms with her identity as a queer Chinese American woman at a time when being both of those things was very dangerous. And I think that commentary was done really well. But oh my god did this book draggggg. I got to a point where I was satisfied. It was a solid read, I was ready for it to be over. And then I checked my audiobook, and it said: 46%. And I was like: wuhhhhhhhh There is no way that this book can do anything else for the next 54%. And it didn’t. It got to the point where the same points were being repeated over and over again and it got exhausting. It kind of reminded me of The Black Kids because we are going through Lily’s life with her but there are also a lot of other bad things going on around her that are supposed to give context to her situation. Which for both books did not work for me. It creates such a disconnect when none of it is present in the actual narrative for the majority of the story but then we hear about it in a timeline dump every couple of chapters. There were also random chapters told in the perspective of her relatives that were TERRIBLE. I also think the discussion about the racism towards Chinese people at the time fell flat compared to the discussion on sexuality. I do want to emphasize that the discussions on sexuality were really well done! It was definitely the high point of the novel for me. Oh and I HATED THE ENDING. ————————————This was extremely long and awfully boring.  Jeżeli szukacie niekonwencjonalnej młodzieżówki, która porusza też kwestie historyczne to koniecznie sięgnijcie po Ostatniej nocy w klubie Telegraph. Przez tę powieść się płynie &lt;3 This is a book that has been recommended to me more times than I can count. I went into it with no knowledge of any of the plot, besides the fact that it was sapphic. That is the best way to approach a book like this.I’m always nervous about reading a book when I see how high of a rating it has but Last Night At The Telegraph Club lived beyond any expectations that I had. This is the perfect example of a book that deserves more hype despite having lots already.When I’m reading historical fiction, this is what I have in mind. I want to learn about the past and read how it is incorporated into the story. This touched on identity, sexuality, race, deportation, communism and many other heavy topics. I felt like I learned so much just by reading this. I also love that it included the translations at the bottom of the pages in scenes where the characters would speak in Chinese. The love, the self-discovery, the found family…It’s not often that a book from the Young Adult genre hits me so profoundly but I will be thinking about this book for a long time to come.I wish I could give this more than five stars.  It's so immediately recognizable and wonderful (but so rare) when books are written for lesbians, by lesbians and about lesbians.Like the main character, Lily, I was also 17 when I realised I was a lesbian. And that was in 2015, so I had a frame of reference, some available representation and much more acceptance than the protagonists of this book could dream of in the 50s. And yet through Lily's narrative, Malinda Lo captures feelings and discoveries that felt so utterly relatable, the timeless realisations of a young lesbian, of how crushing it feels the moment you know you will never be able to fulfill society's expectations but how FREEING at the same time. The spark of recognition when you instinctively notice other women like you. The awkwardness of a first real crush and the unbelievable joy when it turns into a relationship. The sense of belonging when you find a space created for you, by other gay women. The guilt that comes with rejecting a nice boy, because you could never feel this way and even though you know you've done nothing wrong, you keep asking yourself "what's wrong with you?". And the learning of letting that feeling go because there is, in fact, nothing wrong and you can finally be happy and at peace, allowing yourself to love women. This is also one of very few books I've read that truly gets and properly shows what butch and femme identities mean. I wish authors of many sapphic romances read this and learn for once. It's clear that it was written by someone who knows and researches lesbian history. I loved Lily realising her love for butches and baby butch Kath finding comfort in her identity, I loved realistic older couples the girls met and befriended and I loved the portrayal of solidarity and community created in such difficult times.My only issue was in pacing, or rather the length of the book. I mean. I didn't mind the slow pace at all, but it did make the ending feel rushed and I wish there was more space to see how more of those events played out. I was very interested in Lily's family dynamics and her conflict with Shirley and found myself wanting to know more about what could happen.  
  
    She watched the changeable gray of the ocean as it swelled and sank; white lacelike foam that swirled on top like cream; the pummeling waves that crashed against the iron-colored rock. It was constantly changing, yet always the same.
  
We think society has changed—become (more) accepting towards homosexuality and not adhering to “normal”—when really, there’s still such a large amount of people who are still the same as it’s described in Last Night at the Telegraph Club. We think the world is constantly changing, yet it’s almost always the same.Too many of my close friends today have been shamed by their own friends and families for being homosexual or bisexual or their gender identity, etc. and all of it has made me realize just how backwards we’re walking. Malinda Lo’s notes on the 1950s, Chinese society, and homosexuality during that time state that being homosexual was categorized as a psychological disorder until 1987. That’s 34 years ago. That is absolutely no time passed. And when I listen to people talk about how all of this is a “trend” or “just a phase” I get the urge to just slap some sense into them because it is anything but that. It is our feelings, our minds, and our souls they're talking about.
  
    She felt the rub of her mother’s wedding ring against her skin, and her mother’s face swam into focus, her brown eyes full of the sharp worry of love, and Lily thought,
  
   You will never look at me like this again.
Don’t people realize how much shit so and too many of us go through just for being ourselves? No, because they’re ignorant and disrespectful. There is no argument in the world that would convince me to understand opposing people’s behavior towards the LGBTQ+ community. Sorry not sorry. It’s endlessly sad that especially and mostly teens have to go through this when coming out to their families and friends, wondering whether they’ll still be treated the same afterwards. Like, come on!It took Lily exactly 63% of this book to fully realize she was interested in Kath romantically in the first place, and even then, she was never able to fully live in her newfound romance. I feel like relationships at these times were always doomed from the start, and barely any survived the government or families. Makes me wonder which one’s the lesser evil.As for Lo’s writing, it took me some time to get into because I hadn’t read the heavy sort for a while, but when it clicked, I enjoyed it. I’m not an expert on that time’s society and especially not on the topic of Chinese societies and culture in America throughout different decades, but it all felt very well-written in the story. The notes on addressed topics provided very helpful and interesting real-life insights, and overall, I find this to be a great work of historical fiction suited for all ages.  you know how when you reread a book, sometimes a different quote sticks with you?this time its: “no. i will always love her, because even though we’re not together anymore, she brought me here, in a way.”__
  “perhaps it was possible, if she closed her eyes and sent out her thoughts along the steel track like a message along a telegraph wire.&nbsp;i love you. i love you.”
its 1954. in san francisco. in chinatown. in a time and place unsafe for girls to fall in love, lily hu, daughter of chinese immigrants, has grown up among the chinatown community but discovers another one: the lesbian nightclub scene. being queer and chinese is dangerous at the time, but as she finds her place with a girl who’s been there the whole time, they risk everything to let their love see the light of day.there is so much beauty in what malindo lo has crafted right here. there’s beauty in opening your eyes and seeing the vast world for the first time, in tender first loves and those who brought you to where you are, there’s beauty in childhood friendships that grow and eventually wane, beauty in immigrant parents who just want to fiercely protect their family.also— there's beauty in learning to live as both queer and asian american in spaces that often did not allow both to coexist. beauty in the power of finding representation via community, and the sheer euphoria of realizing you have never been alone.lily is a queer asian woman, an intersection that reflects mine. lily and kath fall in love in 1954, an era not too far off if you think about it. but what continues to boggle my mind since the first time i read this book till now, is how as someone still living in somewhat traditionalist asia, what lily and kath had seen would’ve probably been what i would’ve seen some two decades ago.in many ways i am safer now, but to think that if had just been born a few years earlier in the early-mid 1990s i would’ve lived through police raids at gay discos? days and nights of stolen kisses and touches goodbye like lily and kath?and that just. floors me. takes my breath away every single time. how it’s like a reminder not to take even the slightest touch for granted because it still feels like magic. lily dreams about outer space and rockets to the moon, but somehow this. just this in itself, feels like something so extraordinarily beautiful to me.  4.25 stars.This is a hard review to write.Last Night at the Telegraph Club is the first time I've ever truly related to a sapphic story. Because it's not just about the romance. It's Lily's Chinese-American heritage, her family's insistence on her being a "good girl", her shyness, her shame, her desire to be free.I might be a grown adult, but I felt, for the first time, that I had been seen.The only other time I related to a sapphic book was Black Water Sister and lol no surprise there. Both girls are Asian. There is a trend.And because I know what you're here for: yes, this historical novel is excellently done. The research and details are impeccable; it's as if I was there myself. It's great to see someone focusing on the forgotten aspects of history -- queer women of color. And there is depth, so much depth. I appreciated how Lo tackled the historical-accurate racism without indulging in trauma porn or unnecessary violence. This isn't just a story about lesbians in 1950s San Francisco. This is a story about Chinese-Americans, their culture and survival, their history. It's about racism and the Red Scare, about Chinatown, about coming-of-age as a young queer woman, and yes, about San Francisco.I admit the pacing is really slow and it reads like slice-of-life more often than not. That's why I don't usually read the genre. But even with the chapters I skipped, I didn't feel like I missed anything, and it still left an impact on me.Highly recommended.  GO READ THIS BOOK RIGHT NOW. this is probably one of my favorite books because I just love the writing style. the way it described things was so amazing. i love the story that it tells and the characters. definitely recommend  3.5/5 I absolutely LOVED this book and it is still all I am thinking about 2 days later. I haven't got my thoughts fully in order yet, but I wanted to try and write a review. Sorry if it isn't super coherent!So first up, this isn't 'a sultry summer romance'. It is a love story, but not a romance. It might seem like a tiny distinction, but you shouldn't go into this expecting something light and romantic. This book is full of romance and queer joy, but it also deals with racism, homophobia and a tense political climate. Speaking of the politics, this book takes you straight into a period of history I have barely seen written about, not in YA books any way. Last Night at the Telegraph Club follows Lily - a 17-year-old Chinese American girl who lives in 1950s San Francisco (specifically, china town) during a time of great change - personally (coming of age, figuring out her sexuality, planning her future) and societally (the 'red scare', laws constantly changing in relation to homosexuality). Now, it is important to note that I am not a historical fiction person. What I have realised about myself is that I don't really like reading about 1) men or 2) sad women, and so much of the genre includes these. But this focuses on Lily falling for Kath, and exploring her identity via the queer scene. I felt butterflies as they fell in love and was so invested in how their story would play out. A lot of my enjoyment of this book was also due to the characters - they were all so interesting, with flaws and strengths, truly intricately crafted personalities. I would read so much more about Kath and Lily, or the side characters (like the two women who opened up an aircraft mechanic shop after the war in Lily's picture - that would be such a good book)!Melinda Lo is an incredible writer. Maybe one of the best I have ever read. She wrote from the point of view of Lily is such a believable way, and it gave a very interesting perspective on this time. She doesn't ignore the fact that Lily is a teenager, and so she doesn't always understand what is going on or pay attention to the things the adults are concerned about, which makes sense for her age! Lo makes up for this via the other POVs (Lily's mother and aunt) and the inclusion of timelines throughout the book.Overall, I cannot explain how much I loved this book. A new all time favourite for me. A glowing 5 stars!  "Do you hear me? Everyone knows you're a good Chinese girl. This is just a mistake."For Lily Hu, "good Chinese girl" feels like a mask she's only recently discovered she's been wearing. Or worse, like a trap—one that finally sprung the night she walked through the door into the Telegraph Club with Kathleen Miller. She's known Kath since they were first in math together in junior high. Now they're the last two senior girls in advanced math, and Lily can't deny that what she feels with Kath is about much more than calculus. For most people, the Telegraph Club is only another dingy lesbian nightclub just beyond the border of Chinatown, but for Lily and Kath it might as well be another planet.As happens often when you have a long to-read list, Last Night at the Telegraph Club by Malinda Lo languished for quite a while before I picked it as my next read. It was worth the wait though. I don’t read young adult that often, but when I do I hope they are all like this one. Excellent historical coming of age story!f/f Themes: 1950s San Francisco, the Red scare, Chinatown, first love.5 Stars  5 stars all the way. The audiobook was exceptional. Wonderful coming of age/ self discovery story. One of the best historical YA I’ve read in a while.  Opinião no Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/p/Co7E-pusw... This book was wonderful! I loved it so much! I’m just going to list everything that made me happy with this book:-Lily Hu and her journey through this book as she figures out her sexuality, and her relationship with Kath-Author Malinda Lo showing us a little of the clandestine lives the non-heterosexual population had to live, and the careful, fine line they had to walk to stay safe. -Showing us how Lily’s family and community and their expectations constrain anyone diverging from the "acceptable”.-The timeline showing major events in the community and Lily's family members’ lives.-Demonstrating how the fear of the “Red Scare” and the government's misguided and often cruel efforts to scare communist sympathies out of the population affected Lily's family.-Lily's totally cool aunt who showed Lily that loving math and being good at it were not weird.  AGHHH LOVED THIS  this was so good, i really think everyone should read it When I saw all the hype for this book on booktok, I was apprehensive to pick it up. You know that feeling where you ate too much of something and never want to consume it again? That was how I felt about YA romances after consuming an abundance of those in 2020. This book restores my faith.I remembered that, when I first received it in the mail, I almost screamed because I saw chinese characters (like letters, not people) in the book. Well, at least until I realized that I lost all of my mandarin-reading abilities. First of all, I think we all need to take a minute to appreciate the atmosphere. This book transported me back to 1950s San Francisco. I could literally smell and see and hear everything described in the book. Even aside from the physical atmosphere, I was transported to the mental atmosphere of having big dreams, first love, and (our favorite) family conflicts. The writing could only be described as tender and nostalgic, and its rawness captured the realities of teenagehood. I enjoyed Lily’s character as well, although she wasn’t that memorable. While I read, I felt all of her emotions: from heartbreak to, well, more heartbreak. (Don’t worry, there were happy parts too)The only critique that I remembered (yes, I have since started writing down notes for reviews so I stop forgetting things) is POVs. There is nothing that takes me out of a story more than POV switches. For this book, although they add context to Lily’s story, I dreaded the switches because I get taken out of the story. This has been said before, but this book really stressed the importance of representation in books. I know that this widely-loved book would mean so much to members of the lgbtq+ community and asian-americans (yes, it did mean a lot to see representation of someone from my community). Overall, pretty darn good.---post-readingthis book is actually just crack because I sat down to read for an hour and I somehow ended up finishing the whole book in two hours and neglected my homework. (sorry, but reading the twelve tables will never be as interesting as this book.) thank you to Penguin Teen for sending me a copy!!  This took a while for me to get going. Some parts of it dragged out a bit too much. I also think the breaking up of chapter/sections by dates and following certain characters sometimes got a little confusing. That said, I really enjoyed this and though some of Lily's family background didn't add much to the story, IMHO, it didn't hurt things."Last Night at the Telegraph Club" follows 17 year old Lily who starts to explore her sexuality in 1950s San Francisco.&nbsp;I really have to say that Lily and Kath's relationship definitely centers this book.&nbsp;The writing was great as I said, but the flow gets a bit wonky at times because we keep jumping to see Lily's relatives. I kept wondering if those sections were going to lead to something, but I didn't see the purpose, someone let me know if I missed something. I really did love the entire Telegraph Club though and the patrons and people we see there. I could have read a whole book about them.&nbsp;The setting of the book is 1950s San Francisco which was a dangerous time to be seen as lesbian or gay in the United States. Also being accused of being a Communist was a real fear in the Chinese American community. Anything that alluded to you not being a "real" American was enough sometimes for people to lose their jobs and homes.&nbsp;Really enjoyed this and think that most young adults will enjoy though think that the jump from an incident to an epilogue (to find out what happened to said person) was a weird choice.&nbsp;  OMG that ENDING.Anywho, I told my wife about this, in incredibly truncated form, and she was bawling like a banshee.So um. Be warned.It's amazing but it's gonna pull on a lot of different emotions.Full RTC.  love love loved this even if it made me ache because i miss being at small bars filled with lesbians and small apartment parties and now i want to go to san francisco again Slow building and fairly anti-climactic. However, I enjoyed the subtlety of the story, carried with beautiful, heartfelt prose. Overall, I don’t regret reading it. Malinda Lo hat es in diesem queeren historischen Jugendroman schon auf den ersten Seiten geschafft, mich in ihr Setting zu transportieren: Das San Francisco der 50er Jahre. Ganz “Coming-of-Age”-Story ist der Plot nicht “zu” extern, d.h. es wird hier eher auf die lesbische Protagonistin Lily fokussiert, die sich durch die (außer)alltäglichen Hürden einer Teenagerin manövriert: erste Liebe, Schulalltag, Familienstress. Wie Lily ihre Sexualität entdeckt, mit den wunderschönen Seiten daran - der ersten Liebe, gegenseitige Unterstützung in der queeren Community - und Dingen wie Selbstzweifel, Nicht-Verstehen seitens der Familie und soziopolitischen Umständen zu der Zeit, ist unglaublich nahbar beschrieben. Was ich jedoch ganz außergewönlich fand war, wie die Verschränkungen verschiedener Marginalisierungen, intersektional und anhand historischer Fakten, bearbeitet wurden - und das auf tiefgehende, aber dennoch verständliche und präzise Art und Weise. Dass Lily im “Telegraph Club”, dem queeren Nachtclub, den sie aufsucht, zum Beispiel Rassismus und Exotisierung entgegenkommt; oder, welche Erwartungen und welchem Druck sie als Tochter einer aus China eingewanderten Familie steht. Wie gerade schon angesprochen, spielen die politischen Umstände dieser Zeit eine große Rolle. Hier fand ich es wunderbar, wie gut die Aufklärung darüber (in kurzen Einordnungen am Anfang des Kapitels) durch die fiktionale Geschichte zur Geltung kam. Das Nachwort ordnet alles nochmal ein und gibt weitere Lektüre- und Recherchetipps über queere Geschichte.Was mir nicht so gut gefallen hat war, dass es immer wieder Flashbacks zu anderen Personen gab. Das hat mich leider aus Lilys Perspektive herausgerissen und ich brauchte immer wieder ein bisschen, bis ich da wieder reingefunden habe. Das Cover ist übrigens so, so passend. Es illustriert das Setting zwischen Chinatown und dem Nachtclub total gut, was es einem einfacher macht, es sich vorzustellen. Insgesamt vergebe ich 4.5 Sterne und spreche eine deutliche Leseempfehlung aus!Danke an Netgalley und den Verlag für das Rezensionsexemplar.   4.5 stars rounded up, rtc  4.5 starsI just want to give lily a big gay hug &lt;33 ✨ find this review on my blog!  ✨
  “Are you like the girls in the book too? Because I think I am.”
i thought of many ways to start this review, -a dramatic declaration of love, a thoughtful question, a jumbled mess of words- before i finally settled on this quote. LNatTC is a book unlike any other, it deftly handles the experience of queer person of colour finding themself and also tackles the homophobia and racism that comes with it.the book follows Lily, a 17 year old chinese-american girl discovering her identity in 1950’s San Francisco, when she stumbles upon a book about a romance between two women. the question -about a queer love- further deepens when kathleen miller, a girl in her class- takes her to the Telegraph Club, a lesbian bar.&nbsp;
  “That book. It was about two women, and they fell in love with each other.” And then Lily asked the question that had taken root in her, that was even now unfurling its leaves and demanding to be shown the sun: “Have you ever heard of such a thing?”
to reduce this book to just a romance, would be a disservice to it.&nbsp; it is a historical fiction and a coming of age and a romance. it’s also a love letter to queer people of colour all over the world who are&nbsp; struggling with their identity, finding their place in this world&nbsp; and facing discrimination in such an intolerant world.&nbsp;TW/CW for sexism, misogyny, racism and racism slurs, internalized and external homophobia and death of a father.this is my first book by malinda lo and it was absolutely stunning. the writing is gorgeous and the characters are brought to life by her vivid prose. it’s a character driven novel with the pace picking up in the second half. the side characters intrigued me, lily’s mother the most, and i loved the flashbacks in the middle of the story and they offered more depth &amp; insight.&nbsp;one of my favourite aspects is that the book also focused on what it meant to be a chinese-american in the 1950’s with the Red Scare. the government is observing and deporting any signs of people with communist ties. despite his hard earned citizenship, lily’s father is facing suspicion and the risk of deportation.&nbsp;another thing that i appreciated was that the book focused on the entire queer community, not just lily and kathleen. i loved the inclusion of other queer side characters -especially lana and tommy-&nbsp; lingering in the shadows, allowing themself a few moments of freedom in the Telegraph Club.&nbsp;my only dislike is that i found the first half too slow and lengthy. perhaps, a few chunks could have been cut out.&nbsp;this was more experience than book and it hit deeply, piercing right in the heart. i probably won’t remember lily or kathleen in a few years but i will remember this book, how it made me feel seen &amp; gave me a voice.overall, this was a fantastic read -albeit a little slow- that touched me deeply and captured the nuances of the QPOC experience. it is one that i would highly recommend!&nbsp;
  An unfamiliar emotion swelled inside her at this image. A strangely sharp pang for a place she had never visited. For a people she resembled but did not know.
----------------------I really enjoyed this!! short review to come :)) BR with Nashita &lt;3  You can find the full review and all the fancy and/or randomness that accompanies it at It Starts at Midnight I fell completely and totally in love with&nbsp;Last Night at the Telegraph Club. It snuck up on me, too. At first it was fine, but I had no strong feelings. But somewhere around a quarter of the way through, I found myself wholly immersed and invested, and by the end I was having basically&nbsp;every feeling a person can have. I will try to explain coherently all the reasons I adored it!  	 ►Lily was such an amazing character. She wants so badly to make her family proud, to be successful, to be a good person. But she also understands, after some soul searching and exploration, what she wants in life. It's incredibly hard, especially given the time period, for her to have both, but she is so determined to find a way. She takes risks, and it's so hard, but she goes for what she wants, and I respected that beyond measure. And please don't misunderstand- she's not perfect. She falters, and has flaws, but at her core she's simply phenomenal and I adored her.  	 ►Lily and Kath together were equally wonderful. I could&nbsp;feel their romance seeping through the (electronic) pages. The tension, when they first became close, their actual romance, it all felt so very authentic. I couldn't help but cheer for them at every turn, and wanted so desperately for these young women to be able to be together without fear and hate.  	 ►The historical setting was so compelling. When we first meet Lily, she's not a gay Chinese-American teen, she's just a Chinese-American teen. She discovers her sexuality as the story develops, but upon first encounter, Lily is in fear not because she loves Kath, but because her father is being questioned by some anti-Communism jerks (that is obviously the technical historical term, right?) and is worried about deportation, even though he's done nothing even close to illegal. Lily even has a scare herself early in the story, where she is at a gathering with someone accused of being a communism sympathizer. Add to it, gay rights are nearly non-existent in 1954. So as Lily is discovering her first love in Kath, and what that means for her, she has to hide who she is, and be worried about&nbsp;another of her identities. It is heartbreaking and infuriating, and Lily is beyond brave even though she should never have had to be. Also, please do yourself a favor and read the author's note. It's incredibly thorough and so well-researched!  	 ►Lily now has to navigate a changing dynamic with family and friends.&nbsp;Because of both her relationship with Kath and her lofty dreams of going to space in the future, Lily finds herself clashing with her loved ones more than ever. Her best friend wants her to basically put on a dress and go to the school dance on the arm of some boy. Her parents want her to "tone down" her dreams. And Lily is over it, thank goodness. But, this doesn't mean it wasn't incredibly hard for her to face that her loved ones may not want what is best for Lily, but what is best for&nbsp;them.&nbsp;  
  Bottom Line: 
I fell in love with Lily, cheered for her through the entire story, and loved every minute. Highly recommend.  AHHHHH OMG THIS WAS SO GOODReview to come aaand I have officially broken out of the reading slump that was April, 2021!! *and the crowd goes wild* Let me start off by saying that I gave this book 5 stars because the amount of love and care the author put into it alone is worthy of the highest esteem. Lo provides a resource sheet and detailed research summaries at the back of the novel that I strongly encourage everyone to read-- this should be the standard of care that goes into writing marginalized characters!! This book took me over a month to read, not because it was difficult or dull (I thought about it constantly even when I couldn't read it), but because it hit so close to home. I am not Chinese, but as a second generation queer Asian, Lily's story was incredibly meaningful to witness. To summarize, the story follows high school senior, Lily Hu, who lives in 1950s Chinatown San Francisco and is coming to terms with what she wants in life. Both in terms of a STEM career and her love life. This book closely looks at the intersections of race, lesbian identity, and immigration in America, and does so with complete honesty. It is such a heavy story and I would caution readers to really take as much time as you need to read it-- allow yourself to process the complexity of emotion Lily and Kath's journey evokes. Lo writes moments of joy and youthfulness as well, but everything is grounded in viscerally real experiences. I am so grateful to this book and the voice it gives to so many coming-of-age journeys. I'm comforted to know that this is a book that will resonate with every one of its readers in different but equally powerful ways, and if anyone else who's read it feels comfortable sharing I'd love to hear how it impacted you!CONTENT WARNINGS: *noted while reading, some may be missing- erotica mentioned- homophobia (internalized &amp; external offences)- traumatic coming out experiences- masturbation- Anti-Asian racism - FBI &amp; police corruption- anti-immigration rhetoric- deportation- mentions of Asian fetishization - creepy predatory old men - sexual harassment- sexism- miscarriage   The ARC of this book was provided by the publisher via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review. 3.5/5 StarsI had been waiting for this book for so long and I'm sorry I can't give it a higher rating. Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad book in any way and there's no problem with it, but it just did not click for me.This novel tells the story of Lily, an American Chinese girl living in San Francisco Chinatown in the 1950s. It's a scary period for Chinese people who are scared because of the American government that suspects everyone of being a communist. The threat of being deported is real and looming over people, even Chinese Americans like Lily.Lily's a girl with ambitions, she wants to go to college and work to go to space. It's her dream and she wants it so bad. She doesn't care about marriage and children like everyone seems to. At school there's one girl who suddenly gets it, it's Kat and she has dreams as well. She wants to be an airplane pilot. The two girl are drawn together and start a friendship that later turns into a sweet and delicate romance. Being two girls in love isn't easy in the 1950s and so the two start to go to the Telegraph Club, a bar where they can show who they truly are with more freedom. Things aren't easy and the two girls are risking everything to be together, but will it be enough?Malinda Lo did an incredible researching job, there are actual additional reads suggested at the end of the novel if anyone's interested in some topics and wants to explore more. The author definitely knows what she's talking about and it shows. Her care in describing every little aspect in the novel is clear.I totally recommend this if you're looking for a YA book that's historically accurate and has a lot of good representation.  Honestly, this is the type of historical fiction that I have been waiting for. I am so tired of the WWII stories that only feature white cishet characters as if BIPOC and queer folks simply didn't exist. Anyways...It is evident from the beginning the sheer amount of thorough research that the author conducted and poured into this story. The story is set in 1950s San Francisco Chinatown. This is a time period where women stopped education after high school in favor of a traditional nuclear family. Interracial marriage was still illegal. Same-sex relationships were viewed as perverse, sexual deviant behavior. And all of this is in addition to the Red-Scare paranoia that was deeply rooted on US soil. And the author beautifully weaves all of this together when telling Lily Hu's story. The Telegraph Club quite literally is the sanctuary for queer folks to come and shed the guises that they wear in order to fit in and conform to society. From the beginning, Lily's sexual identity is clear, but her suppression due to the need to be a "good Chinese girl" for her family and community as well as to avoid being the target of gossip at school was heart wrenching. So watching Lily change from being this hesitant and insecure person regarding her sexuality to fully embracing her identity and finding those who love her for her at The Telegraph Club was amazing. There were so many other things about this story that I absolutely loved (e.g. Lily's determination to continue an education in STEM, which was unheard of for women at the time, the racism and hardships that Chinese Americans faced during this time period thanks to McCarthyism, and the vastness of the queer community during a time period when it "just didn't happen"). Thank you to Penguin Teen for providing a review copy through NetGalley. This did not influence my review. All opinions are my own.  lesbian, chinese mc + lesbian love interest (+ other lesbians/sapphic people, and the mc's Chinese family lol)I kept getting ads for this book, but I'm honestly really glad because it was really good. Of course, we love to see a queer Asian protag; this is the type of thing that makes me feel SEEN ( I mean I'm south Asian, not east Asian, but still, it makes me so happy to see any Asian rep at all, and QUEER Asian rep?? ugh I love it). I liked that the romance wasn't the sole focus of this book; it ended up being secondary to the main focus, which was of course the main character's relationship with her family. I loved the inclusion of Lily's Chinese culture. I loved the way Lily slowly pushed boundaries, going to the Telegraph Club and reading the lesbian book she found at the store, despite what her immigrant family was like. One thing I saw another review mention that I agree with is that Lily never calls herself a lesbian, though it's heavily implied. Irl, it's not important to label yourself; do what you want! But in the media, explicit representation is very important, especially with the word lesbian which is so stigmatized and sexualized. As a lesbian, I would've like to see that. However, that's a pretty small complaint. This was such a cute queer romance with an Asian mc that explores being gay both in a historical setting, and with an Asain immigrant family, and I'd highly recommend giving it a read.  Last Night at the Telegraph Club was such a beautiful story. The representation in this book means so much to so many queer Chinese-American readers. Having this story take place in the heart of San Francisco was honestly what drew me in from the first page. I love learning about California’s history--especially the Bay Area--and seeing all the familiar places that I’ve spent so much of life at being such a pivotal part of Lily and her family’s story was incredible. I really did feel like I was pulled into 1950’s Chinatown through Malinda Lo’s scene descriptions. I also loved how Malinda connected Grace, Joseph, and Judy’s stories to Lily’s to emphasize the intergenerational conflicts within this family. The ending was also so bittersweet and I wish we had seen more of Lily and Kath together. I think a few chapters of resolution before the jump to the epilogue would have made the story seem more tied together. I also would recommend this book for upper YA readers (16+)! It does feature a lot of heavy and mature themes, including homophobia (explicit), lesbophobia (explicit), miscarriage, misogyny, racial slurs, racism and has slightly more explicit content than most YA novels. Overall I’d give this novel 4.5 stars!  DNF at page 133. I bought this book and began it with much enthusiasm. However, despite knowing ahead of time that this was a young adult novel, with which I don't normally have an issue if handled well, the writing style ended up being just too juvenile for my tastes. The secondary and tertiary characters felt too similar in personality, and the main character had that odd feeling of disconnect that I associate with much, much earlier young adult novels (I mean, it almost put me in mind in tone of a Nancy Drew novel). I liked the idea of this novel and its broad strokes, but the execution fell flat for me and left me dreading to pick it up and trying to push through the pervasive boredom. That being said, I recognize the many positive reviews and high ratings, and I love that books like this are out there and that they reach so many people who get so much joy out of Last Night at the Telegraph Club.  I must tell you that two of my least favorite things to read about are space and the 1950s. However, Lo managed to crack my hesitation with the promise of a lesbian love story set in SF Chinatown and I’m SO grateful I opened myself up to this story. The history! The love story! The setting! All of it. I want to sell this hard to adult readers because the majority of us don’t know the history contained in this book. I dearly hope HS readers pick it up too, because it is a glorious tale of staying true to yourself despite every possible obstacle. For queer youth, it may help them feel more hopeful about the state of their world today where a lot of progress has been made. All in all, a treasure of a story. Librarian note: contains sex and alcohol use, main character is 17 and lots of the story is set in a bar. Recommended for HS and adult collections.  4.5/5it’s been forever since i read a historical fiction novel and this was the perfect book to reintroduce myself to the genre! the writing was so amazing, i felt transported into the book. i really loved the main character, lily, and her relationship with kath (i liked how it wasn’t rushed at all). characters in historical fiction can sometimes feel hard to connect with, but lily’s perspective felt so real. i listened to the audiobook and the voice sounded kinda robotic at first which made it a little difficult to get into but after the first couple chapters i was completely immersed into the story. overall, the writing style in this book was fantastic and i would recommend it to anyone who’s a fan of (young adult) historical fiction. i loved this book and i could definitely see myself rereading it in the future!   4.5 stars. Self discovery in 1950's San Francisco in a compelling descriptive historical piece that both made me feel like I lived it and like Lily was my best friend and telling me this story late at night after a few drinks. There were moments that made me stop and put down the book for additional processing time. There were gorgeous details that I had to read over and over because so much was said in a few words like the description of cigarette ash missing the tray on the table. Cultural tension, sexual tension, political tension. All of it gripping.Minus a couple tropey moments, this book was phenomenal.   This was absolutely fantastic and tugged at my heart strings a whole bunch. Hopefully review to come soon 💜Instagram | Blog | Booktube Channel | Twitter Após vários livros pesados, estava a precisar de uma leitura mais leve e este “Ontem à noite no Telegraph Club” cumpriu muito bem esse propósito. Uma história bastante bonita, apesar de simples, e com uma escrita mais simples ainda. É um bom YA, que se lê muito bem. 3.5/5  CW: racism, micro aggressions, usage of slurs, homophobia, xenophobia I don’t usually gravitate towards historical fiction; even when I do, it’s been largely limited to romances or WWII European settings. But when I realized this book was about a queer Asian American girl in the 50s, I knew I had to pick it up immediately. And this was just wow. I have always heard a lot about the author Malinda Lo, how she is a pioneer in both bringing Asian American authors as well as sapphic fiction to YA mainstream, but I never got around to reading any of her works before. However, I now realize why she is considered to be such an inspiration. The writing in this book is beautiful and stunning - I felt transported to 50s Chinatown in San Francisco because that’s how powerful and vivid the author’s descriptions are. It’s both an exciting coming of age story of a young lesbian girl as well as a daily chronicle of life of Chinese American high school girls of the time - and I really loved how the author did justice to both aspects of the story. The story might feel mundane at times, but it’s still high stakes and there were so many moments where I was scared, happy, devastated and hopeful - it takes us through a gamut of emotions and it’s a true testament to the author’s skill. Lily is a typical Asian American child in many ways. She is a dutiful daughter like her parents expect, concentrating on her studies and socializing with kids whose families are acquaintances. But she is also an American who wants to be free and is ambitious enough to want to go to space and just wants to create her own destiny. In the midst of this turmoil of trying to fit in with both worlds, especially when she is not completely welcome in one, she also grapple with the realization of her sexuality - which is both thrilling and scary. But the author does such a brilliant job of bringing all these aspects of Lily’s personality to life and I loved her so much. Her complicated friendship with her childhood friend, a budding forbidden relationship with another young girl and just wanting to know more about this new community that she could possibly belong to - it’s all very vividly captured and made it very easy to empathize with Lily. The way the author explores various relationships, especially the ones between lesbian women whom Lily meets, who are trying to live their life and find places where they can be themselves, left a very deep impression on me. Having recently read a couple of books about Asian American history, it was very intriguing to read more about McCarthyism and the red scare of the 50s, and the author shows us how terrifying it must have been for the Chinese Americans of the time, who had dedicated their lives to be good citizens but still had to prove that they weren’t communist sympathizers, sometimes while realizing that anything they did would never be proof enough. What really surprised me was that there was also a fear during the time that homosexual was related to communism, and the author deftly explores how this would cause even more chaos in the life a young queer Asian girl, who is now doubly scared of being deported (or of her family being subjected to it) both for her sexuality as well as her ethnicity. The author’s note at the end goes into much detail about what inspired her to write this story and how difficult it is to find more information about the lives of girls like Lily. In the end, this is a coming of age tale of a girl whose stories are usually missing from the historical fiction genre - queer Asian Americans. As we all know that it’s even more difficult to be openly queer in Asian families, it’s really important that we get to read more of these stories - so that young Asian kids know that they aren’t alone. If you like YA or coming of age stories or just historical fiction, I highly recommend this book.   Boy I did not like this book. There is just a lot here that did not work for me, but before we go into that, lets talk a little about me. So I am a cis, 20-something year old Asian dude, meaning my perspective towards this book might not be the same as someone who is gay/lesbian. I say this just to say that my rating is based on that perspective, and if you're somebody with a different perspective than me, you may enjoy this book more and that's completely 100% alright. Anyways, so somewhat related, the text in the title by Emily Pan states "This is a book for everyone who is has every loved - in any sense of the word." Yea so that is a straight up lie. This book is very specifically about a lesbian relationship in the 1950's, it's told primarily through those lens, which made it difficult for me to relate on a personal level because its really not a universal feeling or experience that is being displayed in the book. Even in the confides of 'love' it's very specifically 'teenage' love, with all the bumps and whistles that may entail. Which is fine, like its fine to have a niche, and not every book is made for everybody, but yea, other books aren't claiming it in the title blurb. But I digress. So even in the confides of a love story, I feel like this book falls short, mainly due to the fact that Lily and Kath don't seem to have any character. Kath is really bad for this, as I can really only say 3 things about her. She's a teenager, she's a lesbian, and she want to be a pilot. That's it. She really doesn't have anything else going for her. She's honestly forgettable, which is a problem because she's the love interest. Also I did not find Lily very engaging, which is problematic because there is no central conflict in this story, so the only thing motivating the reader is hearing Lily's thoughts and how she processes them. But I feel like Lily isn't saying anything unique?? Yeah she has some flowery prose or interesting metaphors, but ultimately her insights aren't interesting. Like what are some of the things she has to say? People were really messed up in the 1950s? Homosexual relationships were complicated in the 50's? Yea, I sort of knew that. And boy did this present a roadblock to me many times when reading this book. For reference, I am fast reader, I can usually put down a 900 page book in a week, but this 350 (on my kindle) page book just took me forever to get through because it was amazing how fast I got bored reading through this book. And furthermore, Lily and Kath are the only 'okay' characters in this book, literally everybody else sucks. Like they do terrible things and have terrible behaviors, which is probably the point of the book, but didn't really help keeping me engaged, maybe raising my blood sugar a little but thats it. Oh another thing that annoyed me, Lily is suppose to be 17 but my mental image of her kept defaulting to a 12 year old. She behaves like a pre-teen, like omg, just freaking talk to people woman. Like early on there is a scenario where she just avoids this guy because he asked her out to the dance. Bro just say 'sorry I'm not interested.' I feel like that aint unreasonable, especially since the choice you ultimately end up doing isn't any better?!?!It's insane. Like I know 17 year old aren't the bastions of good decisions, but they have more reasoning and problem solving skills than this. Come on Lo. Anyways I could go on, but needless to say, I did not like this book, which sort of sucks because I acknowledge that this is a point of view that needs talking about, I acknowledge there a words in this book that need to be said, but the story just isn't a very good story in a technical sense, that I cannot recommend it unless you fall within the group this story is trying to reach out too.  
  How precious she was, and how miraculous.
A little while ago, I sort of gave up on Malinda Lo, just kind of deciding that her style wasn't for me. I'm so so glad that I reconsidered&nbsp;that and gave this book a chance, because I liked it so much.I haven't read a lot of fiction that takes place in the American 1950s, smack dab in the middle of the red scare. And I've read none before this that take a teenage, lesbian, Chinese-American perspective. This was incredibly&nbsp;well-researched, very character-focused, with a lot of emphasis on history and the main character's internal musings, self-discovery and personal growth. Coming out/self discovery in a historical milieu is always so amazing to read, and it was perfect here. It was intense, and made more so because of the era, and Lily being unsure that girls like her even existed, and the euphoria that came with finding out that she wasn't alone. It didn't quite have a found family vibe, but there was definitely a sense of community in the Telegraph Club, and the joy that Lily found there with Kath and all the other women. The romance was wonderful, but it wasn't centre-stage. It was about Lily coming to terms with herself.
  It was like finding water after a drought. She couldn’t drink enough, and her thirst made her ashamed, and the shame made her angry.
The historical titbits were fascinating, and so I obviously wanted more. I thought the subplot with the communist group was going to be way more consequential than it actually was; same for a few side characters who didn't end up having as much stake in the story as I hoped/thought they would. I would have liked to have seen a few more scenes talking about space/Lily and Kath's aspirations. The ending definitely wasn't as fleshed out as I might've hoped, and a few things happened off screen that I wanted to see.Thankfully, I had no other nit-picks than these. My main grouse with Lo is usually that there's too much head-hopping in her books, (my biggest writing pet peeve) and this book was blessedly told solely in Lily's third person POV. There were some flashbacks told from the perspectives of side characters, but they were good, and added atmosphere and context (though truly, I wouldn't have enjoyed the book less without them). Listened to the audiobook as read by Emily Woo Zeller, which was really fantastic and really helped with my enjoyment. I just adore the timbre of her voice,a nd she's really talented when it comes to voices and accents. Check out Hsinju's review for more thoughts on this. I'm really pleasantly surprised. I probably won't read any more of Lo's backlist, but I'll keep an eye out for her future work!  5 stars! * 
  
    "...we’re never what our parents expected."
  
 Last Night at the Telegraph Club was such an easy read for me. Malinda Lo's writing flowed so well and made it so I immersed myself in the story and Lily's perspective right away. I particularly loved the little timelines to give us historical context regarding what had been going on around the time the story takes places--even more so on how it related to the characters' personal history. I'm not someone familiar with this period in history in the USA since I'm not USAmerican, so it was pretty interesting to have that information on hand so I could do my own research as I read.I also really enjoyed Lily as a main character and the primary narrator of the book. The first few chapters with her knowing there was something different with her and how certain things made her feel certain ways hit so close to home (although I am bisexual and not a lesbian!) and I loved how organic that felt and the way Malinda Lo slowly established Lily figuring herself out through new experiences and friendships.The setting of the Telegraph Club and what it meant was also so so so cool. It meant a lot to me that Malinda Lo made the decision to give Lily and Kath a place where they could meet people like them and interact and be reasonably safe and free of judgement. The baby butch comment legit almost made me cry because I've rarely read scenes of older queers accepting baby queers into the community in YA books out there? And it made me so hopeful to see that in a novel as a way to show readers that there have always been places for us in the world and there always will be.My one complaint would be that the ending felt a tiny bit rushed? There was a major twist towards the final few chapters and I would have loved to see more of the aftermath instead of having been told, in very broad strokes, what happened. I did love love love love love that the book ended on a happy and hopeful note because that also made me almost cry a little bit lolI'll definitely be checking out Malinda Lo's other works because this was an incredible read for me. Recommended to anyone looking for novels with lesbian protagonists! * Series: Standalone.POV: Told mostly from Lily's POV.Content Warnings: Period-Typical Racism and Homophobia.Instalove: No.Love Triangle: No.Cliffhanger: Nah.HEA: More hopeful than happy!  Generally speaking, historical fiction isn’t really my thing. But queer historical fiction set in the 1900s? Give me all of it. The setting of 1950s Chinatown really gave this book a unique point of view and atmosphere. The story was an interesting mix of Lily figuring out her sexuality, falling for a girl at school, discovering a lesbian bar called The Telegraph Club, family pressure, and the Red-Scare paranoia that impacts her Chinese American family. A couple years ago Malinda Lo published a short story called “New Year” in All Out: The No-Longer-Secret Stories of Queer Teens Throughout the Ages. I was so excited when I realized that this book was an expansion of that story since it was one of my favorites in the collection. If this was a story on AO3 it would definitely be tagged with “Period-Typical Homophobia.” Because the story takes place in the 1950s there’s a lot of homophobia from the characters outside of Lily and the women she meets at The Telegraph Club. Also, as a Chinese American teen Lily does end up facing racism from some of the people around her. While there are some very heavy things that happen throughout the story, the main focus is not on trauma. Ultimately this does feel like a hopeful story even with the negative things that do occur. My main criticism is that I don’t think the little sections of the book that were following Lily’s parents and aunt’s POVs years before the main storyline were necessary. I thought they brought the pace of the story to a halt and didn’t add enough to make them worthwhile. Sometimes it would be that a super dramatic thing happened with Lily, then before you can find out what happens next there’s a boring section from her aunt’s perspective in the past. While those sections did give more insight into the lives of a different generation of characters and the struggles they faced, they didn’t feel like they totally meshed with the main plotline. Overall this was a really lovely story about sexuality, young love, and lesbian bars in the 1950s.  "She felt as if she had finally cracked the last part of a code she had been puzzling over for so long that she couldn’t remember when she had started deciphering it. She felt exhilarated."Meet seventeen year old Lily Hu, who lives in San Francisco in the 1950’s. She is Chinese American and dreams of going to college and working with her Aunt at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, to assist with getting a rocket into space. Her and her friend Kathleen Miller, aka Kath, are the only two girls in their advanced math class. Kath dreams of becoming a pilot one day. Over time, Lily finds ads in magazines of male impersonators and is fascinated. The ad slips out of one of her books one day while she is in the bathroom, and her classmate Kath finds it. She tells her that she has seen the male impersonator in the ad before, Tommy Andrews, at the Telegraph Club. She tells Lily she can take her if she wants to go and Lily agrees. She wants to explore the feelings she has that she cannot quite explain yet. Over time, Lily’s feelings for Kath change from that of a friendship to something much more.Malinda Lo did an unquestionably, fantastic job with this YA historical fiction LGBTQ novel. She touched on a subject that many authors have not written about; being an Asian American teen that identifies as a lesbian in the 1950’s. This was during a time when being gay was considered illegal, where there could be no public affection shown between members of the same sex, and when gay members could not congregate in bars/clubs. It was also during a time when the government was looking for communists. One wrong move, and Lily and her family could potentially be deported just based off of who they socialized with. Lo did her research and it shows. I especially appreciated the “Author’s Notes” section at the end of the book which gave additional information and pictures. I believe this would be a great read for younger members of the LGBTQ community.My only critiques would be that towards the middle of the book it felt a tad slow. I also wished there was more information on how Lily and Kath’s relationship turned out. In the epilogue, their relationship status is left open and I wished I knew more about what the future held for them.  I liked this a lot more than I thought I would. This is a very important look at life in the 1950's, under the shadow of the McCarthy Red Scare, and how it affected the Chinese American population particularly. I didn't know about the Exclusion Act (I mean, I knew OF it, but I didn't know ABOUT it, and what it really meant). I also didn't know about raids on gay bars, and male impersonators. I really loved Lily, and I felt so proud of her for speaking up, for figuring out what she wanted, and who she was. I liked a lot of the characters, and found others upsetting (they were supposed to be, don't worry). I liked the epilogue and the author's note particularly. Also, this was great to listen to, because it allowed me to the hear the Chinese the way it should be pronounced. And I really liked her voice in general.   I finally finished this. and like wait, it deserves all the hype.4.5/5 starsGet your tissues because this one will melt your heart 🤧 1954 is not a great time for Chinese immigrants in America. Let alone, a lesbian one. So when Seventeen-year-old Lily starts having intrusive thoughts and feelings about girls, she finds herself in a twist. Kathleen Miller doesn't help with that. By taking Lily to a secret lesbian club called "Telegraph Club". Lily lives in Chinatown, where people with very conservative views live. Red-Scare paranoia threatens everyone, Including Chinese Americans like Lily. With deportation looming over her father's head, Lily can't make any mistakes as all eyes are on her. But as she looks into Kathleen Miller's eyes, she hears a voice much stronger than herself calling. That voice is love. And Lily felt herself following it. Lily Hu was annoying, reliable, and frighteningly relatable. She was, for the most part, annoying especially if you listen to the audiobook. She reflected a character that never knew what to do or what was going on which was pretty annoying. But even when she never knew, she always had a solution that was again annoying and confusing. So we never really got to see her thought process. It was just, there is a problem that needs to be solved, so it was solved. Kath (Kathleen Miller) Kath was strong, smart, and funny.I love her so much and wish to read more of her. She was so cute in this book and made such a good impression. I hope that this standalone turns into a series because I would love to see more of her.The Writing was spectacular. It boosted the book in every way. It made the characters seem more interesting and added a bit of mystery to the book. It was informative and descriptive in a beautiful kind of way and I absolutely couldn't have it any other way. The Plot was engaging and fun. It kept us on our toes. But be warned, you won't be able to put it down.   Last Night at the Telegraph Club is a story about Lily Hu, a 17-year-old Chinese American, who lives in Chinatown, San Francisco. She begins a "friendship" with a fellow student and discovers the underground queer community in San Francisco by going to the Telegraph Club. Lily also realizes the trials and triumphs of being herself but has to do so in the shadows of the night. This heart-wrenchingly real book not only shows the difficulty of being a queer individual during the 1950s but also the prejudice active in the lgbtq+ community (and in society) towards Asian Americans. The discomfort of being the only Asian individual in a crowded room bled out of this book and seemed to stain my hands. The desperation Lily Hu had to express herself in public like the heterosexual couples she saw shined through Malinda Lo's writing. This book had the most neutral yet intriguing writing I've ever read. It wasn't crowded with excess descriptive words or with confusing figurative language but it was perfectly entertaining. I had the utter glee of turning page after page seeing ​Lily eat various, perfectly described, Chinese dishes and sneak out to go to the Telegraph Club. Malinda Lo perfectly incorporated the Chinese culture into this book; it was understandable and felt like a figment of Lily's identity. Sometimes when you read a book you feel like something is missing and the book missed the opportunity to say or do something. That wasn't the case with LNATTC. Everything was perfectly exacted and it couldn't be a better historical fiction novel. It felt fresh and easy to read but it had the atmosphere of 1950s Chinatown. Prepare to feel like you've been gut-punched.  reread march 2022: this book sparks so much passion and curiosity in me and such a reverence for the past. still just as good, if anything i got even more out of it the second time around.“rockets to the moon didn’t seem so far-fetched when kath listened to her.” 🚀 this month i read last night at the telegraph club for @teatimereadings book club! a historical fiction set in 1954 following a queer chinese-american main character, it’s such a special read! personally, historical fiction has always been a part of me, even if it’s not my favorite genre anymore, and last night at the telegraph club was everything i wanted it to be. it was so unique and truly a testament to love and time and history. our main character, lily, was also such an amazing lead. she changed and learned so much over the story, about herself and her sexuality, about friendship, about love, about politics, and just was such a dynamic character. her interest in stem was also a stunning inclusion. lily was able to defy everything she was told was right when she knew it was wrong, and she was one of the strongest female protagonists i’ve ever read.malinda lo captured such a beautiful and painful and true story, and i highly highly recommend this to anyone who wants a wonderful ya historical fiction.🔻content warnings: abandonment, parental abuse, family trauma, sexism, misogyny, racism, racial slurs, deportation, death of a loved one, homophobia, internalized homophobia, miscarriage, police brutality🔺  I've honestly been wanting to read one of Malinda Lo's books for years now, but never got around to it. After having finally done so, now I'm not sure if I'll be reading more . . . maybe the queer Cinderella retelling (Ash, I think?).&nbsp;This was well-written and I liked it, and the premise is well-thought out and a bunch of other complimentary things . . . but this was just a good read for me, not great. I chalked it up originally to just not being the book for me at that time, and I think I was right in a manner of speaking. But I think "that time" is a more general "because I'm older". I think this book would have been more impactful when I was younger. But also, I really have not been drawn to books that aren't genre-heavy over the last year. I crave a mystery or some magic or something weird, and this was pretty normal and kind of sedate.The insight into queer history was great, with the male impersonators and 1950s McCarthy-era paranoia. In fact, as many in our book club discussion said, the parts that interested me the most about this involved the adults and their lives as immigrants and people impacted by China's Cultural Revolution, among other things. The NASA aunt is barely in the book and she was so cool!There is a follow-up to this book being published next year, but I don't think I'll be checking it out. Never say never, though.  3.5 stars. Historical stories about queer characters are important to fill in all the gaps in the stories people have been allowed to tell. But they can also take a toll on the reader, since they are often centered around queer suffering or being closeted. This novel manages to have a lot of queer joy in this coming-of-age story, and it isn't as painful in the hard parts. They are mostly saved for the end of the book, and it's both realistic and optimistic, which I appreciated. For me it was just the right balance. The best parts of the book are the ones at the Telegraph Club, where our protagonist Lily gets to see queer women being out and comfortable and happy. But Lo really builds a whole world for you here, especially of 1950's Chinatown. Make sure you stay for the author's note with all Lo's research at the end.I did the audiobook, it has a traditional style of reader (they tend to be more monotone for the narration but have a variety of voices) and while I don't always love a traditional reader this was a good match of reader to material. Her voices were rarely distracting, she had great variety, and she was particularly good at the characters speaking English with a Chinese accent or speaking Chinese.   — 4 STARS —Almost forgot to review this, sheesh.Quite the novel! This book was an atmospheric, detailed exploration of 1950s chinatown. I loved how it sought to fill in the cracks of history, by giving us a lesbian perspective in a time where such a viewpoint was not allowed. Lily’s coming of age story was very realistic while still being hopeful. Although this story focused more on historical accuracy than the plot or characters, I was still rooting for Kath and Lily. It doesn’t sanitize any of the struggles a teenage, chinese-american lesbian would have faced back then, but it doesn’t romanticize queer suffering either. More than anything, this book showed me the importance of Own Voices — you can feel Malinda Lo’s connection to the experiences shown here, that I didn’t feel in other historical novels (aka Evelyn Hugo). I have issues with the pacing — much of this was kind of repetitive and slow, only to rush at the end. However, I was still impressed with the detail and care Lo put into this, and I’d love to read more historical wlw novels in the future.  I waited for this novel to pick up the pace, but it never did. The plot proceeded sluggishly, interrupted by flashbacks and weighed down by an abundance of unnecessary scenes and descriptions. I appreciate the research that went into it, but there really was no need for the reader to know the name of every single street the protagonist walked down or every single meal she ate. It's a shame, because the characters are sweet and a tighter editing would've greatly improved the book.Additionally, the fact that every lesbian couple in the book consists of a butch and a femme, and the insistence on the allure of women dressed as men, left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. This is addressed in the historical notes, noting that gender was perceived as a binary concept and lesbians were generally "black or white... butch of femme". Still, I can't help but feel that a little more nuance could've been used.  this book was so underwhelming. everything was easily predictable and the book was just plain boring. i can usually read a book of this size in two hours or so but this took me two entire days. half of the chapters are filler with no relevancy. id also like to add that the love interest has close to no character depth and its as if shes irrelevant. the characters are supposed to be 17 but no teenager would act the way lily does especially in that one scene with will like come on girl are u fucking stupid or something  ⭐⭐⭐⭐ rainbow stars🌈🥺❤I literally wanna cry this book made me super emotionalThere is so much i wanna say i wanna cry about in this review but i just can't get the words outThis is a must read for EVERYONEBuddy read with Ash❤✨  absolutely LOVED this. first must-read YA contemporary i've read in a loooong while. 1950s lesbian culture meets american born chinese coming of age in a still unfortunately very racist world. such a treat, though i wish i'd gotten to see a bit more of a true happily ever after screaming and crying Lily Hu é uma rapariga jovem sino-americana que vive na ora calma, ora frenética Chinatown de São Francisco, na Califórnia. E Last Night at the Telegraph Club conta a sua história, a história de Lily à medida que ela percebe quem realmente é. Ela não sabe bem ao certo quando a questão brota – se foi quando viu a foto da Tommy Andrews, a drag king de São Francisco ou se foi quando leu excertos de um livro lésbico numa livraria –, mas Lily acha que gosta de raparigas. Ela já tinha ouvido a palavra gay, obviamente sempre dita pejorativamente ao seu redor – um insulto, uma doença –, mas a palavra lésbica? Não, é algo estranho, anormal até. Mulheres podem amar mulheres? Maravilhoso! Contudo, as descobertas de Lily vão para além de pedaços de neologismos e autoanálises, tudo muda quando ela e a sua amiga, Kath Miller, entram no Telegraph Club, o icónico bar frequentado por todo o tipo de pessoas. Casais de turistas que buscam satisfazer as suas curiosidades exóticas ou, melhor ainda, mulheres que amam mulheres e que partilham momentos de prazer e entretenimento ao verem espetáculos de drag da Tommy Andrews no palco. Em plena América da Guerra Fria, em 1954, com leis de exclusão racial e de discriminação por orientação sexual a serem impostas constantemente pelo governo, Last Night at the Telegraph Club espelha uma realidade histórica por muitos ignorada: São Francisco dos anos 50 era a capital queer dos Estados Unidos, e embora apagadas pela história, havia nessa cidade mulheres asiáticas que eram queer, que amavam mulheres, que faziam drag e frequentavam bares como o Telegraph Club. Lily, apesar de fictícia, é uma dessas mulheres. É um livro que tem tudo: é um romance maravilhoso, na medida em que nos conta uma história de amor lenta, mas quente e violenta; é um livro histórico, porque nele é evidente todo o trabalho de pesquisa feito pela autora por trás – é possível detectarmos frases simples e subtis que denunciam o medo intenso ao comunismo na sociedade americana, a implantação do maoísmo da China e o aumento consequente do ódio à comunidade asiática que habitava os Estados Unidos na altura –, mas essa pesquisa nunca chega a ser aborrecida. Malinda Lo trabalha engenhosamente com o ritmo da narrativa, incluindo factos históricos na perfeição e sem se afastar muito do seu núcleo. É verdade, ficamos a conhecer um pouco sobre a corrida ao espaço ou a guerra das estrelas evidente entre os Estados Unidos e a União Soviética na altura, mas a autora partilha essa informação porque a própria Lily adora ficção científica, porque a Lily um dia gostaria de ser astronauta e ir ao espaço e porque a tia da Lily trabalha como um computador na NASA. A informação que nos é dada nunca chega a ser desnecessária, uma vez que esta trabalha simbioticamente com o próprio enredo. É um livro cheio de camadas, que brilha ainda na sua luxuosa e apetecível exploração de um romance jovem, entre duas raparigas que ainda estão a tentar descobrir quem são, que têm dúvidas e questões e medos enormes que as assombram, mas que, ao mesmo tempo, sabem que se amam, e para elas, isso basta. As descrições são lentas e sofredoras, o romance cresce em todas as dimensões porque nós acompanhamos todos os momentos em que as personagens estão juntas, nós sentimos o que elas sentem quando entram no Telegraph Club pela primeira vez – o receio de não se sentirem integradas ou então o medo de saberem que encontraram um lugar aonde pertencem; a excitação de estarem perto de mulheres sáficas diferentes e corajosas ou então as borboletas na barriga de, talvez, serem também mulheres sáficas. Last Night at the Telegraph Club transmite um enorme calor interior que é difícil de colocar em palavras. É um livro sobre tudo, sobre família, descoberta, amizade, amor. É uma representação justa da sociedade americana de meados do século XX, embora encapsulada num pequeno lugar de São Francisco. Não há um único capítulo ou linha de ação que achei desnecessária, tudo foi orquestrado com carinho e atenção dignas de tornarem Last Night at the Telegraph Club um romance histórico ideal. É emocionante tanto no romance protagonista entre a Lily e a Kath como na própria caracterização da protagonista nas suas dinâmicas familiares, escolares e entre colegas. É refletivo porque me fez pensar sobre quem somos – nós que amamos e queremos amar, sem limites, sem regras, sem preconceitos – e também sobre quem já fomos – nos tempos do ontem, do hoje e do amanhã, quando o amar simplesmente por amar não é suficiente para alguns e para outros, é demais. Consegui sentir as luzes néon ao entrar no Telegraph Club e consegui ouvir as batidas dos corações palpitantes daqueles curiosos para o próximo espetáculo. A Tommy Andrews, vestida com roupas de homem, a cantar. A cantar sobre amar mulheres, sendo mulher. A Lily a ouvir e a descobrir-se, a apaixonar-se. A ganhar coragem, a elevar a sua voz, a ser verdadeira. O mundo, a ouvir também, confuso sobre se deve ou não deixar o amor acontecer. E, ao mesmo tempo, o tempo a passar, inexorável e inevitável, e nós a tentarmos capturar aquilo que vivemos e sentimos. Sentimos muito, vivemos pouco. Emily X. R. Pan, também escritora, disse que «este livro é para alguém que já tenha amado – em qualquer sentido da palavra». Não podia deixar de concordar. Nem todas as histórias têm finais felizes, mas este amor teve. Este amor. summer book bingo da @dorasantosmarques - "onde gostarias de passar férias"  a new all time favorite!!!! Ho questa voglia incredibile di bestemmiare perché questo libro called me out in diecimila modi diversiNiente, non so davvero cosa dire perché non riuscirei mai ad esprimere a parole ciò che questo libro mi ha fatto provareIl romanzo inizia in maniera tranquilla, lentamente e dà esattamente l'idea di trovarsi dento a un ricordo, per cui tutto sembra quasi ovattato, attraverso un filtro. Ma passo dopo passo la narrazione diventa più attiva e in molti casi veloce e ansiosa, e trasmette bene il senso di segretezza e paura della protagonista, Lily, alle prese con la scoperta di sé e conoscenza, "consapevolezza definitiva" della sua sessualità.Il primo approccio con Kath, la loro prima uscita di nascosto per andare al Telegraph Club, libri "scandalosi" che mostrano personaggi "deviati" e "sbagliati" che lasciano un senso di disagio e inadeguatezza, pagine di riviste strappate e preservate con foto di donne che impersonano uomini, la paura che qualcuno possa scoprire questo e soprattutto te, il tuo segreto più profondo che è l'unica realtà e verità di te ma che sai dovrai tenere nascosta per sempreIl tutto misto ad avvenimenti storici drammatici, tra il rischio di deportazione dei cittadini americani cinesi e le incursioni per scovare comunisti o persone omosessuali, per cui sai che ogni tua mossa rischia di essere vista e notata dagli occhi sbagliati e ogni tua conoscenza potrebbe costarti cara. Ma allo stesso tempo la storia riesce ad offrire momenti di leggerezza e spensieratezza, tra la scoperta del primo amore e il brivido di fare qualcosa che il resto del mondo pensa sia sbagliata ma tu sai che invece è giusta e ti definisce, ti dà un luogo, gente, a cui appartenere nonostante tuttoIl contesto storico è favorito anche dall'inserimento, alla fine di ogni parte del romanzo, di capitoli da parte anche dei familiari di Lily (la, madre, il padre e la zia, che avranno ruoli importanti per il finale della storia)È doveroso sottolineare la presenza di eventuali trigger warning per momenti di omofobia e soprattutto lesbofobia, razzismo e amicizie tossiche. Cose che, seppur dolorose, hanno reso questo libro, nonostante si tratti di un romanzo storico, tremendamente, sfortunatamente, anche molto attualeDevo ammettere che la scena del coming out (forzato) con l'amica e successivamente con la madre, mi ha distrutta emotivamente e fisicamente e i loro risvolti hit a little too close to homeNonostante questo, però, il finale lascia un piccolo, immenso spiraglio di speranza e nuove possibilità, che spero vivamente Lily abbia colto, ma che sono sicura, dopo tutta l'evoluzione compiuta dal suo personaggio in questo libro, che abbia avuto modo e forza di fare senza voltarsi indietro  TW: omofobia, razzismoMi sento parecchio delusa da questa lettura.Era una delle uscite che attendevo maggiormente nel 2022, invece purtroppo le mie aspettative non sono state soddisfatte. Forse perché mi aspettavo una storia diversa, ma vi dico già che NON è assolutamente un Evelyn Hugo 2.0.Quel libro è inarrivabile e irripetibile.La notte scorsa al telegraph club è un qualcosa di già visto e fatto. La premessa è anche interessante: Lily, ragazza cinese di 17 anni, che vive a San Francisco negli anni '50, quindi un contesto chiuso e bigotto, realizza di essere lesbica. Ora, comprendo che probabilmente l'obiettivo di Malinda Lo fosse quello di trasmettere le ingiustizie e le discriminazioni vissute dalla queer e asian community all'epoca. Però, arrivati nel 2022 è davvero ancora necessario narrare storyline LGBTQ+ con dolore e dramma? Non faccio parte né della comunità asiatica, né di quella saffica, però ci sono state parecchie scene che mi hanno triggerata durante la lettura, quindi non oso immaginare per le persone rappresentate. Penso che servano più storie con la queer joy, e La notte scorsa al telegraph club non è tra queste. Inoltre, la ship non mi ha coinvolta e non ho apprezzato com'è stata gestita la situazione. Ma perché un altro problema riguarda la caratterizzazione dei personaggi, che è inesistente. Lily è una delle protagoniste più scialbe di cui abbia mai letto, non ha un percorso di evoluzione, anzi è sempre in balia di ciò che gli altri scelgono per lei. Kath, l'interesse amoroso, è una figura mono dimensionale perché la vediamo solo tramite gli occhi di Lily e oltre alle informazioni base, non sappiamo nulla di lei. Paradossalmente, spesso ci sono capitoli interi su genitori, zii, amiche, compagnia cantante da cui otteniamo più informazioni che sui personaggi principali. Lo stile di scrittura non è memorabile, e da persona bianca caucasica non mi sento di aver arricchito il mio bagaglio culturale dopo la lettura e mi dispiace. Mi è sembrata un'occasione sprecata, poiché non ho imparato nulla di più sulla comunità cinese rispetto a ciò che già so, anzi questo romanzo secondo me contribuisce ad alimentarne gli stereotipi. Non so se è stata una scelta voluta da Malinda Lo, visti gli anni in cui sono ambientate le vicende. Resta il fatto che oltre a provare rabbia per le micro/macro aggressioni che Lily subisce, non sono riuscita ad empatizzare con quello che le succede. Secondo me resta sempre un problema di scrittura, perché un* brav* autor* ti permette di immedesimarti anche in situazioni che non vivrai mai. Ad esempio, nella trilogia de La Quinta Stagione di N.K. Jemisin percepisci le discriminazioni, gli abusi e l'odio che i personaggi neri subiscono, come se li stessi vivendo anche tu, persona bianca caucasica e privilegiata. Qui semplicemente manca quell'empatia di fondo. L'alone di mistero intorno al Telegraph Club è più interessante del locale stesso, da cui mi aspettavo qualcosa di differente. Il finale non è soddisfacente come 3/4 della storia.Diciamo che ho apprezzato le prime 150 pagine e la scorrevolezza del libro.Per il resto non mi sento di consigliarlo.  Marvelous. “Haven’t you ever wondered what it would be like to have nothing keeping you attached to the ground?”Ay este libro. Belleza de libro, belleza de historia y de personajes. Siento que este libro no es para nada lo que me esperaba, pero realmente no sabía lo que iba a pasar porque no me acordaba nada de la sinopsis (la acabo de releer ahora que he terminado el libro). Pero esta historia me enganchó demasiado, me enamoré de cada página, y tiene toda la pinta para ser de mis libros favoritos del año.Imagínate esto: 1950, Estados Unidos, una adolescente hija de inmigrantes chinos que está descubriendo su sexualidad, y entiende que sus sentimientos son muy diferentes a lo que ella creía. Pero está la amenaza de la guerra, de que Estados Unidos está acusando a inmigrantes chinos de ser comunistas, de que la homosexualidad no es aceptada en casi ningún lado. La tensión y el miedo que sentía todo el rato por lo que pasaba Lily y su familia es algo indescriptible, y me hace sentir tan mal que aún al día de hoy existan personas que tienen que vivir con ese miedo de ser quienes son y amar a quien quieren amar. La historia, las emociones que desea transmitir la autora, todo llega al corazón a través de sus palabras y sus escenas, y siento que la manera en la que este libro está escrito logra su cometido y transmite su mensaje. Los personajes me han robado el corazón. Siento que el hecho de que la autora lograra incorporar algunas escenas con puntos de vistas de los padres y la tía de Lily ayudó muchísimo a conocer más no solo de la historia de estos personajes, sino a aprender más de la historia de la comunidad china en Estados Unidos en esos años, del fondo de la vida de Lily y de cómo ha sido el ambiente donde ha crecido y lo que se espera de ella a partir de todo lo que han vivido sus padres. Y eso hace que entiendas aún más lo que está sintiendo Lily en todo su descubrimiento, y cómo cuando conoce a Kath, alguien completamente sorprendente y diferente a todo lo que conoce. Ambas tienen una personalidad que me hizo conectar con ellas, y me robaron el corazón. Incluso los personajes desesperantes (como Shirley), se me hicieron tan bien hechos, que me dieron mucha lástima y, a la vez, siento que los entendía. Es una situación muy complicada, y cuando la analizas desde distintos puntos de vista, llegas a entender lo que es vivir en un ambiente así, donde la libertad no era una palabra con mucho significado.En fin, me voy por las ramas. El romance es precioso, es lento pero lindo, es tan precioso que les juro que me motivaba a seguir leyendo. Me hizo sentir muy triste, asustada y emocionada por las emociones que transmitían las protagonistas. Estoy muy feliz de haber encontrado este libro.  Fabulous book. I couldn’t put it down.  Slow paced, emotional, queer, and historical fiction. This story is so well developed and crafted.  This....was so.....SO.....brilliant. I loved every single page of it.Yet another pick for my YA themed book club, I am thrilled one of my friends chose it because I had not heard of it. As soon as I read the description I was hooked. The characters were fantastic, the history was incredibly well researched, and even though it was set in the early 1950s, I challenge any LGBTQ+ person to tell me MC Lily's experiences didn't somehow resonate with you. Time knows no boundaries for these kind of intrinsic emotions. I would so love to see Kath's story next.....  4.5 Ostatnio miałam zastój czytelniczy, a mimo tego udało mi się przeczytać „Ostatniej nocy w klubie Telegraph” w dwa dni (ok.430 stron). Wciągnęłam się niesamowicie, naprawdę, płynęłam przez to jak przez mało książek. Styl pisania autorki jest miękki, piękny i pełny kolorów&lt;3 „Ostatniej nocy…” przez część książki mnie otuliła. pokazała dziwny, może gorzki komfort, a później okropnie, niespodziewanie i nieoczekiwanie uderzyła. Powieść ta jest jedną z bardziej klimatycznych jakie czytałam, istg. tak niezwykle czuć san francisco, lata 50, kluby, neony✨Warto też wspomnieć, że ta pozycja porusza kilka ważnych problemów - rasizmu, homofobii, seksizmu oraz deportacji podczas czerwonej paniki :(po tym jak główna bohaterka - Lily robi coming out przed rodzicami spotyka się z brakiem akceptacji z ich strony, czytało mi się to okropnie, czułam ból razem z nią. autorka idealnie przedstawiła to jak czuła się Lily przez odrzucenie ze strony najbliższych. Sytuacją, która mnie bardzo, ale to bardzo zabolała to amerykańskie naloty na queerowe kluby :((Oczywiście cała lektura jest o relacji wlw - świetnej relacji wlw. Lily i Kat z biegiem czasu stworzyły wspaniałą więź, która była zdrowa i piękna&lt;3 jako czytelnik czułam ciepło bijące od dziewczyn między sobą, komfort jaki sobie dawały, po prostu urocze i wybitne Krótko to podsumowując - Malinda Lo ma cudowny styl pisania, napisała cudowną relację wlw poruszając przy tym wiele ważnych problemów w świetny sposób&lt;3  
  Last Night at the Telegraph Club
 is a well-told story about a young woman’s awakening amidst turmoil around her.In 1954, 17-year-old Lily Hu dreams of a job in science like her aunt, who works on a computer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. But that’s not what good girls do—her mother expects that she’ll meet a nice man and raise children.Lily wants more than going to dances and flirting with boys like her best friend Shirley. She can’t figure out what’s missing—until she sees a romance novel about two women, and everything seems to click into place, including her fascination with male impersonators. She draws closer with her classmate, Kathleen, who takes her to the Telegraph Club, a lesbian club in downtown San Francisco. But to live her truth means risking it all—the disapproval of family and friends, and potential criminal action, as homosexuality isn’t legal in 1954.This is an emotional, well-written and well-researched story, which touches on post-World War II treatment of Asians and the growing fear of Communism. The flush of first love and realizing who you are was captured so accurately.See all of my reviews at itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blogspot.com.Follow me on Instagram at  https://www.instagram.com/the.bookishworld.of.yrralh/.  Wow This Book Was So Good I Loved The LGBTQ Representation That This Book Had And I Am So Happy That It Is Being Represented In A Good Way I Loved Kath And Lilly As Characters I Thought Their Romance Was Soo Cute I Loved This Book And You Should Read It   Incredibly well-researched, profound and poignant. What a gem. 5 ⭐️ Literally the best book I’ve ever read in my entire life!! I’m crying right now, nothing will ever come close to this!😭😭 ugh i love lesbians wish i could be one oh wait this novel is set in san francisco in 1954, when the red scare runs rampant, a threatening time for chinese people across the u.s. seventeen-year-old lily hu struggles to come to terms with her sexuality in a time where being queer isn’t accepted and her father is actively facing the possibility of deportation. but when lily’s classmate kath invites her to the telegraph club, a lesbian bar, lily can’t deny that part of her.i don’t think i’ve read many (or any?) books set in the 1950s, but i really enjoyed this one. i love coming-of-age stories and i like how this book explored the intersection of queerness and being chinese in this time period. i also really enjoyed the author’s note at the end that gave more background to what was happening during this time and how hard it is to find stories like lily’s.i highly recommend this book!  Oh my god. I am just gonna cry forever over this amazing fucking book! This is probably Lo's finest work to date. I loved seeing Lily discover her sexuality and figure out how to be safe in the midst of 1950's America. I'm really looking forward to her cameo in Lo's next book. Can't recommend this one enough.

Very melancholy; I craved a happy ending but knew I wouldn’t get it. I’ll take the bitter sweet one I’ve been given and shut up. Update (August 2022) --&gt; rating: 7.5/10I stand by what I said before, I still believe some chapters could've been cut short and that the main characters should have been explored more. However, I still think about this one from time to time, wishing I was able to find similar books. I remember how it dares to explore topics very few YA books delve upon, how charming the protagonists were, how unique the story was. So I'll give credit where credit's due. If you're into books that are slow-paced and character-driven but also charming and thought-provoking, you'll definitely like this one.Rating: 6.5/10Long story short: this book was a major disappointment. I'm sadder than that time I dropped my ice cream right after buying it. Now, before you call me a cold-hearted monster, here are the details: Last night at the Telegraph Club follows Lily Hu, a Chinese American high school senior living in San Francisco in 1954.Lily’s parents are Chinese immigrants, and her whole family needs to play it safe and stay under the radar, or else they’ll be deported back to China. All Lily wants is to be a good daughter and fulfill her life-long dream of pursuing a career in Math and working at the Jet Propulsion Lab. Yet when she reads about a male impersonator working at a lesbian nightclub, the Telegraph Club, she feels compelled to see the performance, even if that means risking her family’s reputation. So when Kathleen, the only girl apart from her studying Advanced Math at her school, offers to take her there, she can’t resist the temptation to see the show for herself at least once. I wanted so hard to fall in love with this book. It shines light on important topics that aren’t usually discussed, it’s told by a unique narrator, and it takes place in the 1950s, a time in history that is usually glossed over by YA books. It’s clear that a lot of time and effort went into writing this book, and I appreciate the author daring to do something new, so unlike the hackneyed tropes we’re used to see in YA novels. The blurb states “her most ambitious novel yet” and indeed, it would have been an astounding achievement to successfully tackle with all these topics (the precarious situation of Chinese immigrants during the 1950s, the life of Chinese American people, homophobia, rocket girls, lesbian culture in the 1950s, Communism and so on) at once. However, the reason I’m not giving this book a higher rating is that there were too many things going on, but most of them weren’t explored nor wrapped up in a satisfactory way, which ultimately left me feeling the book was disjointed and unfocused. To start, we shift focus from Lily’s storyline in the 1950s to that of her family in previous years. These past perspectives don’t add much depth to the characters nor play an important role further down the line. Instead of enriching the book, they interrupt and draw attention away from the real protagonists of the novel. I understand that the author wanted to give some background, I just don’t think flashbacks were the best way to do it.Even in the present, there are elements that are mentioned several times only to be left hanging in the air, leaving many questions unanswered. It's not that the book has an open ending, it's simply that many conflicts that arise are left completely unresolved. While other narrators are given their own chapters, the real stars of the book apart from Lily (Kathleen -the love interest- and Tommy Andrews -the male impersonator who accounts for most of The Telegraph Club’s success and who’s also the main reason why Lily and Kathleen get together) don’t get nearly as much attention as they deserve. It’s frustrating and disappointing that the most interesting characters are so underdeveloped. I wish the flashbacks had given us a glimpse into Kathleen’s past instead (especially her friendship with Janet, the first time she went to the Telegraph Club and the time she asked Lily to help her with a geometry exam).Had the execution been different, I would have recommended this to everyone. But as it is I'd recommend it to readers who are willing to overlook the loose ends this book never ties up, and who don't mind slow-paced, character-driven novels. I enjoyed my time with Lily, and I think many people will too, but it upsets me that Last night at the Telegraph Club fell short of my expectations in so many aspects. It could have been so much better.  i am crushed I LOVED THIS BOOK - it's a YA masterpiece, one of those YA books that I would recommend to adults who think they don't like YA (hi Rachel N!)Beyond all the deftly handled subject matter around historical San Francisco Chinatown, the Red Scare, and queer history, and beyond the tender and sweet romance, this book has one of the best depictions of a complicated female friendship I have ever read.   niby nie mój gatunek, ale bardzo ciepłe uczucia żywię do tej książki 4.5* A young adult, queer historical fiction, Asian-American character driven novel? FINALLY! Thank you, Lo, for this beautiful story. Set in San Francisco's Chinatown, we are introduced to Lily. As a Chinese American during the Red Scare time, there is real fear of being deported. On top of that, she's realizing her feelings for other women and is trying desperately to be the "good Chinese girl" that she's supposed to be but also trying to find a way to seek out her actual desires - not just in her sexuality but also in continuing her education and finding her true self along the way in all aspects.Lo certainly has done her research and it shows throughout the pages. Lily's experience as an Asian American and daughter of immigrants resonated greatly for me. And even when she finds her space within the Telegraph Club, she's still shunned by other lesbians due to her Chinese ethnic background. She can't seem to turn around without having something against her and it's an extremely scary time for her and for her family. I don't even know how to properly put my thoughts down on this one. There's no doubt that Lo is an amazing writer. The racism and homophobia happening in the 1950s is unfortunately still rampant in the present day... especially so with the pandemic and anti-asian hate going around. It is nice though, to see how a community finds a way to make a safe space, the Telegraph Club.This is a novel that we need out in the world. It is extremely character driven, which did at times flow a bit slow for me but that's just a me thing and not taking anything away from this novel. What I focused on was Lily, her fight within the means she was given and then foraging her own path. The relationships we see are extremely well written and I really just wanted to reach in and hug them all.  Sapphic historical romances are definitely one of my favourite genres!Last Night at the Telegraph Club follows 17 year old Lily Hu on her journey of self discovery. Set in the 1950's, this was primarily about Lily figuring out her sexuality against a backdrop of communism and how the US treated Chinese American immigrants/citizens.First off, I want to say the author got Lily's questioning spot on. I saw my younger self reflected in this book several times, and that was such an amazing experience. From little things like shyly looking away from women and not really understanding why, to larger situations like going to a gay bar for the first time. I know these experiences won't be the same for everyone, but the emotions described were similar to my own. I enjoyed this book so much for this alone.I expected the whole communism thing to play a larger part, but I understand why it wasn't that prominent. As mentioned above, this was Lily's story, and the communism plotline didn't affect her much.Her and Kath were sweet together, but I thought the relationship was underdeveloped. It very much seemed like Lily's first love, and she would move on as she grew up. When they met up again in the epilogue I was pretty surprised tbh.I didn't like the flashbacks from her parents/aunts POV's at all. They seemed pointless and jarred me out of the book. I skimmed the last couple to get back to Lily.I did think the showdown with her parents/family was really well done. The dread of them finding out had hung over the entire book, and it delivered. I felt so helpless and just wanted to protect Lily from everyone.One last thing—I didn't really like the writing, I just think it wasn't my style. That didn't effect my enjoyment for the story too much though!This definitely jolted me out of my reading slump. I really enjoyed it!  dnf at 53% ://i couldn't care less about the characters, and it had major potential, but it did not give what needed to be gave This was fine... I think that some parts of the narrative were executed better than others, some played more to what I like to read about than others did. I did find myself wishing that some of the pages had been used better, or maybe that the book could have been a little longer. Overall some of the focus felt off, especially given how the final fifty or so pages of the book plays out. Definitely leaves off on this melancholic note, that I definitely think Lo was aiming for, but given how parts of the narrative before then played out, it doesn't feel entirely earned either. Then the epilogue...So yeah. I'm not sure who I would say this book is for. I did like the historical aspect, getting to see that play out. If you want to go in rooting for the romance... I would say to adjust your expectations because I found that very much felt like an afterthought to a lot of the other things happening in the narrative.  “Now she laid the women pilots on the bed next to Katharine Hepburn and Tommy Andrews and looked at them all in succession. She couldn’t put into words why she had gathered these photos together, but she could feel it in her bones: a hot and restless urge to look—and, by looking, to know.”TO LOOK AND BY LOOKING TO KNOW!!!!!!!!!!! MY GOD. malinda lo has been changing the game since i was in MIDDLE SCHOOL and i am so grateful for this work. oh to be gay in public!!!!!!!!this book is so gorgeous and sad and hopeful and had me making involuntary horrified/delighted noises of recognition and remembrance. to look—and, by looking, to know. what a privilege to look; what an honor to know. THANK YOU MALINDA  This was good. I think my main issue was that I wasn't really in the right headspace when reading this. And I think it was because it was young adult that I was kind of eh about it. For sure if I was reading a sapphic adult romance with some spice, well hell ya. That being said, I would recommend this to any young adult out there. This was cute, relevant, even for the 1900s and enjoyable. Just not really for me.   oh boi, i’d risk it all for the yearning and tenderness this book made me feel. I absolutely loved the way Lily’s emotion, and her love for Kath were described. I also really loved the whole political and cultural context and especially loved reading the author’s notes. You can tell she did a lot of researches. So glad i read this!  This was a great coming of age story set in 1950s San Francisco. Each section provided a timeline of significant events for the Chinese American community and the legalities pertaining to gays meeting in public places. The falling in love for the first time feeling was very well portrayed. I will definitely be reading more by this author.  (Changed my rating to five stars because couldn't get it out of mind)Lily raised her fingers to her lips as ifto touch the last trace of Kath’s mouth on hers. She felt a queer giddinessovertaking her, as if her body might float up from the ground because shewas so buoyant with this lightness, this love.*Happy tears*  ugh this book makes my heart acheIs this my new favorite book?? EVER???? such a refreshing read and also an emotional one. I’m not a big fan of historical fiction but I am so glad I read this. The writing and the characters are amazing. Malinda Lo! Thank you for not writing a Lesbian Tragedy novel the epilogue! Swoon This was practically perfect.  Ta książka tak bardzo bolała, bo była realistyczna. Zaimponowało mi przede wszystkim, jak sprawnie autorka przeplatała wydarzenia fikcyjne z rzeczywistymi faktami historycznymi. Pokochałam również, jak dobitnie ukazano obraz okrutnych i frustrujących stereotypów, powszechnych w latach '50. Wierzcie lub nie, ale czytając o przykładowych absurdalnych zachowaniach, byłam tak bardzo zirytowana, jakby ktoś mówił mi to w twarz. Z rzeczy przyjemniejszych, wątek romantyczny poprowadzony został w przepiękny sposób. Motylki w brzuchu są dla mnie wyznacznikiem "jak dobra jest dana lektura". Ta zdecydowanie spełnia ten wymóg. Bohaterki przez cały czas odnajdywały siebie, usilnie próbując dowiedzieć się, co tak naprawdę czują i jakie są naprawdę. Dzięki temu w epilogu były ogromnie silnymi kobietami, co pokazało ich niezwykłą wartość. Książka ta przypomina mi trochę "Arystotelesa i Dantego". Akcja dzieje się powoli, pokazane są ważne problemy i tematy historyczne, a postacie przechodzą pewnego rodzaju glow up wewnętrzny. Ari i Dante to moja ulubiona książka, więc Klub Telegraph raczej również dostąpi tego miana.   ✩ 4 stars~tw: homophobia, racism, racial slurs, xenophobia, miscarriage, underage drinking, family estrangement~“Haven’t you ever wondered what it would be like to having to keep you attached to the ground.”•“Perhaps one day she’d get used to the way it made her feel.

It's very well done! Check out my full review here!!! :) Bookish Brews | Twitter | Pinterest | Tumblr | Facebook  This book is an absolute masterpiece. Following Lily, a young Asian American who is traversing figuring out her sexuality, the red scare, family, friends and much more during the 1950’s. Lo did a wonderful job writing Kath as well. You really feel for both of these characters. I loved seeing young people during this time and the under ground queer clubs that they had to go to since homosexuality was so outlawed back then. It was also beyond heart breaking to see how Chinese Americans and immigrants were treated during the time communism was in the rise. Lo did her research on the history of the time period. Also after the epilogue you get to hear her story as well. This book is a must read for everyone. CwXenophobiaHomophobiaBullying Toxic friendshipViolence Immigration  loved this !! 10/10 recommend  {4.25} TW: period typical racism, homophobia, sexism*edit* bumping this to 4 starsIf you are looking for a way to break into the realm of historical fiction this is a great book to do it with. "Last Nigh at the Telegraph Club" is the story of two girls falling in love in 1950's San Francisco during the red scare. Chinese-American teenager Lily Hu is our main character and she is captivated by the Telegraph Club which is a lesbian bar she sees an ad for and thus begins her journey of self discovery. She is fascinated with the feelings she has for the club as well as their main act, Tommy Andrews, a male impersonator. She befriends a girl from her school, Kath, who has been to the club and they begin to go together and lose themselves amid Communist anxiety and harsh prejudice against homosexuals. This story is about Lily finding herself both in terms of her sexuality and who she wants to be. We see her grow and learn about her new feelings as a relationship between Lily and Kath develops and Lily owns her sexuality. I read a lot of historical romance but most of it is based in the regency era and follows straight white love stories so I was really looking forward to breaking out of my comfort zone. This book was a great way to start reading about a different historical era while still focusing heavily on romance which I loved. I have to admit that I think this is the first story I've read that focuses on a WLW relationship and I am here for it. Lily and Kath made my heart ache as their connection felt so pure and their fondness for one another was so human (if that makes sense). I felt like I was right there with them experiencing their journey. Lo's writing drew me in and I could always visualize exactly where she wanted the reader to be whether it was bustling Chinatown or the Telegraph Club filled with warmth and new experiences. The classroom scene with Kath and Lily was probably the highlight of this book and I literally can't describe the feelings it gave me. Watching Lily figure out her sexuality and discover herself was so poignant and the way that Lo wrote everything was so nuanced. I sped through the last chunk of the book anxious and greedy for more as there were so many questions I had that needed an answer. However, while there were many positives to this book I also had a few problems that really hindered my reading. For instance, one of the main conflict points is that this story takes place during the red scare with the threat of deportation for Communism running rampant. But, there really is no conflict or big event regarding the threat of Communism. It felt like just a backdrop and I wish the author would have done more to use it as a plot device. There were a few mentions of it affecting Lily's family but it's really never touched upon again in a major way. In addition, there is a scene where Lily unknowingly goes to a youth Communist group picnic that some of her friends are a part of. However, the picnic is only mentioned once or twice and then forgotten about and those characters are pushed to the side. Even towards the end when there is a seemingly important discovery that I thought would be talked about more it is quickly covered during an argument and then boom done. There are also a lot of chapters that follow Lily and her childhood best friend Shirley as they navigate their bumpy friendship. This in itself isn't a bad thing as I think it added to the story and helped readers understand Lily and her relationships better. The problem is there were so many unnecessary (in my opinion) scenes with them including random picnics, dress shopping, and more preparation for Miss Chinatown. While all of this is happening there is a huge part of the climax that is yet to be answered and we as readers have to suffer through these chapters while still hoping our questions are answered. Unfortunately, I really feel like my questions were never answered. There is a big conflict scene towards the end that is very important and emotional but the actual ending left me unsatisfied. I was disappointed and I felt like the epilogue came way too quickly. What happened? Time passes and we never really get answers which left a lackluster ending for me. Furthermore, there are a few chapters that include POV switches to Lily's aunt, mom, and dad that I felt pretty unnecessary. If anythingLily's aunts chapters made some kind of sense for the plot but the mom and dad just felt out of place. So while I spoke of quite a few negatives above my overall enjoyment of this book kind of outweighed them. This love story will stick with me and I encourage others to read it. I'm giving it 3.5/5 stars, it was beautiful book filled with love and heartache and It exposed me to a different time with different culture i received a free ARC from Penguin Teen via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. Thank you Penguin Teen for the chance to read this wonderful book.  That's a grand book! Let me begin by congratulating the author for all the research she has done on this book. Lily and Kath's story is just a cover for telling a much bigger story. This is the Chinese culture that lives in the fifties in America and the LGBTQI+ community.Here, we learn about all the challenges that our main protagonist, Lily, has to face as being a Chinese descendent as well as finding out and come to terms with her sexuality. The author also gives us an overview of the political environment surrounding the United States and China.I can understand why many people like and dislike that book. I read this one with friends and they thought it was a bit boring, due to the whole historical portion of this book. If you don't like it either, maybe this is not the book for you. If you do, enjoy this marvelous writing!  I absolutely loved this book 🥹🥹 Such a beautiful book with plenty of bench markers on what was happening politically before and after Lily’s coming out journey. I’ve not read anything like it and feel this story will stay with me. Read this gorgeous romance. You won’t regret it. I've enjoyed Malinda Lo's work before, but this is a much more mature and nuanced work than her previous novels. It is an exploration of life in 1950s San Francisco, drawing together the world of Chinatown and the thriving gay and lesbian bar scene. Lily Hu is seventeen, and gradually realising that she is a lesbian: the word is never spoken, but pulp lesbian romances in the local drug store, and the advertisements for lesbian bars, help her to realise that she is different. She is an ambitious girl, hoping to work with rockets and on the space programme, but the background of McCarthyism and the Red Scare encourage extreme conformity, and she's trying to balance being a good American girl and a good Chinese girl. Lo adeptly handles all the difference forces pulling on Lily's psyche: the racism she experiences at school and out in the world, the pull of her family's ambitions for her, her own ambitions and interests, and her own lesbianism. It's a tightly written, engaging novel, full of the atmosphere of San Francisco and the magic of self-discovery, as well as the tensions of fear and homophobia. At times, I wanted the book to be longer and explore some elements in more depth, but it works within the bounds of the YA genre, and, in some ways, transcends it. The least believable element is the romantic relationship: Lily meets Kath in school, and discovers that Kath has been to the Telegraph Club to see a male impersonator. Lily wants Kath to bring her along, and the two become friends. The friendship between two baby queers is very believable, but the clumsy romance becoming love feels tacked on to the rest of the story, and I think the novel might have functioned better if it was about friendship and identity rather than romantic love. That's a small criticism of a hugely rich and interesting novel, though. I found myself comparing this with Jade Snow Wong's Fifth Chinese Daughter, which is a memoir set in San Francisco's Chinatown of the 1930s and 40s. It was interesting to see the threads that remain the same in the two very different stories, as well as the very different experiences highlighted in Lo's historical novel. The intersections of Chinatown and the gay and lesbian culture are fascinating, and I really appreciated Lo's afterward, which explores her sources and the historical facts she integrated into the narrative. Highly recommended, this is gripping and fun to read, but also a fascinating glimpse of what it meant to be both Chinese-American and a lesbian in the 1950s.   really a 4 star read but i'm sentimental baby lesbian lily hu coming out to herself and falling in love with baby butch........... cries. this was really so lovely and obviously written with a lot of thought and tenderness and investment and the fact that it exists is marvellous for me specifically, to the extent that it felt a bit surreal in places. i do think that the writing is stilted in places and the book definitely gets too caught on historical context — the interludes about about lily's relatives revealed nuances of different attitudes and policies towards migration and were interesting but didn't really add to the story. i guess this book is about navigating identity within a hyperspecific context but these flashbacks felt heavyhanded. if anything, lily's parents and aunt could have sat her down and had conversations with her about their journeys and come across as more fleshed out characters that way (i certainly knew very little about my own parents' migrations growing up, almost as if the emphasis was on expectations for future generations). i do think Telegraph Club depicts filial piety excellently as a subtle but persistent burden that has shaped lily's life and actions until this point. i really think she is so brave and wonderful, and i liked the idea of her stepping out into the world in the end even despite the fear and hardship. "Something went still inside Lily, as if her heart had taken a breath before it continued beating."the truth is that i still struggle with my sexuality frequently and here were words for so many things i continually experience and it really did comfort me in the way that lesbian media often does. it makes me sad that there are no more lesbian bars and worried that i will spend my whole life reading about things and not experiencing a real life sense of connection and community but maybe the global pandemic is getting to me. &lt;3 so true  
  "It wasn’t like chocolate, Lily thought. It was like finding water after a drought. She couldn’t drink enough, and her thirst made her ashamed, and the shame made her angry."
Lily's exploration and discovery of her sexuality was such a powerful experience to follow, which resonated with me and I'm sure many others. Lily's shame and confusion at realising who she is, a common experience of most queer people, is amplified by the restrictions of the time and her family's views and their shaky status with the government. Her journey to acceptance isn't easy, and the ending isn't unrealistic for the time, but there was something so heart-warming about reading Lily's story. We didn't get to see much of Katherine's character, but the romance felt natural and developed perfectly. I can guarantee that there will be times when you want to shout at the characters to finally get together, but who doesn't love a sapphic slow-burn?There was so much packed into this book that sometimes it suffered from not exploring one aspect in as much depth as it could have. Some characters and sub plots didn't feel fully resolved by the end and left me wanting much more. The impact of Communism and events in China is present throughout the book, but the threat seemed distant and the mini plot line didn't end up going anywhere. However, the glimpses we did see were fascinating, and the treatment of Chinese Americans and lesbian culture were the strongest themes. This story gave a fresh insight into Asian Americans during and after World War II that I hadn't considered much before, with links to McCarthyism and the Chinese Civil War. The lesbian community and nightlife in the 1950s was another hidden part of history that I knew nothing about. It was so interesting to explore queer history in a new light, and validating to just know that queer people have always existed in history.cw: homophobia, racism, misogyny  This book is wonderfully well done, and I loved it even though I spent 80% of it with my shoulders around my ears. Even though this is fiction, reading it felt like reclaiming a tiny part of the erased history of queer people, especially queer people of color, and that was a delight and a joy. This book felt real and honest and accurate, and while it is telling no real person’s story, the author did a lot of work to make sure that it *felt* like a real person’s story. And to me, as a queer person, that is immensely important, immensely valuable. That the story is so good is, honestly, just an added bonus, but it’s an incredible one.However, this is the story of a Chinese American girl, Lily, falling in love with a white Catholic girl, Kath, in the 1950s, so even as I loved the sweet story of their relationshp and Lily’s discovery of herself, I was cringing, waiting for the world to crash down on their heads. It was almost a relief when it finally did; for one thing, Lo doesn’t go for any of the cliches (not that I thought she would), and for another, Lily manages to wrest some agency and personal growth out of it. (It was still an outing, and I hate those in stories, but this one — honestly, it was not nearly as bad as I feared.) She’s also narratively kept safe, which was a relief. Still. Waiting for that crash was painful. I just wanted them to be safe and happy and supported!Fully recommend this book. It is fantastic. (If you can take the tension, that is.)  I was not expecting to love this book for a few reasons. I liked Ash a lot as a young person, but I haven't really connected with Malinda Lo's writing since then, and particularly disliked her contemporary thriller from a couple of years ago. I also don't love historical gay romance that isn't within the confines of the romance genre--it's often tremendously challenging to balance out the bummer elements in a way that feels worth it to me. But I really, really loved this book!I have a few complaints--namely that the one-off multi-POV chapters don't really contribute enough depth to balance out the wrench they throw into the momentum of the story--but overall I found this to be a completely engrossing and beautiful book that punched me hard in the chest every chapter. 1950's San Francisco is presented in a mesmerizing and vividly detailed sprawl that I wanted to read about forever. I don't even want to talk to anyone about this book because I'll probably cry, and that's the best compliment I can give.  I like most the 'realism' shown in this book, from the China Town setting to Lily's character as a Chinese girl born in the USA, back when LGBT communities suffered persecution by the States. Although I would like to read more of Kath and Lily's interaction, my impression was that it's not the author's wish to write this as usual romance fiction. Instead, she wants to show us, readers, that 'this is how it was back then.' The story helped me realize that how far we had come. These days, our society (and some parents) had become more open. We are treated as human beings. And lots of us don't have to suffer as Lily and Kath did. All thanks to the many sacrifices of those who fought for our rights to live true to ourselves. Finally, I would like to say that books have come and gone. Many names could disappear from people's memories in ten, twenty years from now. But I hope this book continues to be remembered and shared.   The main story was absolutely a beautiful 5 stars. But this book contained SO MUCH RIDICULOUS FILLER (there is literally a paragraph letting the reader know the sky was blue and the gras was green) that I wanted to give it a 2 at times. One of the most interesting parts of Kath and Lily’s relationship takes place between the last chapter and the epilogue and it made me so angry that instead of exploring that, we got a lot of back story that didn’t really have anything to do with the main plot points. Some of the plot points were so major or seemed so important to the author (and they were important to me!) that they should have been their own books, but instead were baby plot points sprinkled throughout this one, making it longer and less impactful. Anyway, Tommy, call me.   3.5 starsI like what this book was in terms of a coming-of-age novel. How Lily grappled with her sexuality and eventually come to terms with it. It was rather nicely executed. I think my favorite thing was the exploration of queer nightlife in the 50s. I do wish it had more explained queer Asian nightlife, though as the author stated in her note, there isn't much documented info regarding that. The elements of the Red Scare, and how terrifying it was to be a Chinese American during the paranoia of the 50s was also pretty interesting. But i found the parts about Lily's parents and her aunt really boring. The romance was cute, but idk i expected MORE from this book. The ending was sad, but the epilogue was hopeful, so there's that. But that oomf factor was just not there.  "I can see them coming a mile away, those baby butches.” Her voice was honeyed, teasing...Rhonda had apparently paid Kath a compliment, and Lily felt an electric clutch in her belly as she recognized it, butch like a blue ribbon awarded at the county fair, baby like a promise."Incredible. Malinda Lo, you did it.There are many coming-of-age LGBT YA novels that touch on self-discovery and first crushes, but not many feature a Chinese-American protagonist. Even fewer are set in a pre-Stonewall time period. I was enthralled. The conclusion was satisfying without feeling like a fantasy.I now have a very intense need to attend a formal drag show at a fancy lesbian bar with table service and a coat check.  “She’s having a hard time right now because you’re not what she expected. But we’re never what our parents expected. They have to learn that lesson.”Set in the 1950s, this is the story of Lily, a Chinese American, coming to terms with her sexuality in San Francisco. She meets her first love, Kath, in math class. This is a story about love, rejection, fear, homophobia, and finally self-acceptance.I really enjoyed Lo’s writing style throughout this book. I do think the middle portion of this novel was slow-moving. But, the last 10 (or so) chapters had me on the edge of my seat. Overall, a well-written book that is incredibly impactful. Would absolutely recommend.   minus points for the uses of the n word which, in my opinion, shouldn't be used by someone that isn't in the community. as much as i understand that it wasn't meant in derogative ways and they are words that are accurate in the time period (like explained in the author's note), it still made me uncomfortable to see it used multiple times throughout the book  I’m honestly surprised I didn’t dnf this. There was no plot, so many useless scenes, and the ending didn’t wrap up anything. This book is a standalone, however the ending left me feeling like nothing was wrapped up.  DNF at 54%I wanted to like this book so bad, but it just keeps on dragging. I don’t like any of the characters particularly much, and they all seem to be rather immature. The concept? Solid. The execution? Lacking. Of the 54% that I have read, it feels like it could be condensed to 20%.  4.5! Very romantic and sweet and I loved the setting. I think it’s a really important book. I wish the red scare storyline felt more resolved.  girls :)))queer euphoria and queer pain all in one, and very well written. 4.5 stars rounding up! 1950s sapphics i love you! this book, not so much. beautifully done and feels like a really nice hug. This book was at times amazing, couldn’t put it down, was blending with the novel (especially the last pages.. it really was something else.) At others, I was at the very back of an empty amphitheater, my myopic-self trying to read a document displayed at the other end of the room (this is a semi-metaphor — the book had a rather small writing size.)TW: homophobia, lesbophobia, miscarriage, misogyny, racial slurs, racism, sex (on page, not graphic)***I honestly felt like the author was struggling with balancing each plot. Which caused me to feel like I was wavering in the story myself. The main plots were perfect. But at times, despite the beautiful, luxurious writing, I felt like the execution of (sub-)plots was poor, unbalanced.I genuinely enjoyed this book in overall. There isn’t a single moment when I really disliked it or felt like not finishing it. I wasn’t necessarily bored either, though some scenes were pointless… I guess the writing made up for it. But I wasn’t looking forward to knowing how the story would turn out either (for the most part). I read for the sake of reading, each page having me either in awe or leaving me underwhelmed.
  Other negative aspects:
1. I didn’t enjoy the flashbacks. I guess they were useful to some extent… But they could’ve very easily been avoided.2. The main love interest lacked depth. I have a very vague overview of that character, which is a problem when they are literally always around. How can I be invested in the relationship of abstract characters? I can’t. Well, I was. But again, to some extent.3. Though I get where the author was coming from, I couldn’t stand how lesbian couples were constantly compared to straight ones. The unceasing repetition of how one girl was dressed like a man or how that couple was dancing like a man and a woman would was.. Fucking annoying. I know, I know. You missed the whole point!. I didn’t, I get it. But it bothered me. A lot. And I guess that was the point. (At least I hope so.)
  Positive points:
1. I loved the consent. No insinuation or implicit consent. Straightforward. Explicit."Can I?" "Yes. Yes, you can." "Am I doing this right?" "Yes. Yes, you are." This. This was hot.2. Basically everything else, which makes up a great portion of the novel. I very sincerely recommend it. It was a great one. 3. Edit: How dare did I not mention the writing? It was astonishingly good, way beyond my expectations. Way beyond.The hype is totally fair. If someone told me this was their favourite book, I’d go "yeah, okay. Makes sense." But relying solely on my impressions, I can’t bring myself to give this over 3.75 stars (which is why I am not rating it 4 stars.) But the worst thing about Last Night at the Telegraph Club, the thing that made me want to rate it 0 and have its pages burned from the very beginning… It’s the fact that I still don’t know what happened next between Patrice and Maxine. Shame on you, Malinda Lo. Be ashamed.Bottom line: Leafing through this book was a roll of dice. But I strongly recommend. I was excited about this one and it honestly lived up to my expectations for the most part. 3,75 out of 5 stars.  ------ ✰ 4.5/5 ✰ ------ “Are you like the girls in the book too? Because I think I am.” ------ Thoughts  ------OHMY GOYUGFDXSD.. this book, THIS BOOK!!!!!! Incredible. A queer historical romance book, Malinda Lo does such an amazing job with writing, storytelling, educating, etc. This book was easy to read, fun, emotional, heart destroying, and just overall fantastic. This book felt exactly where it was, in the 1950's, she does so well putting you in that decade. She does it with simple things like music and clothes, to more upsetting things about the time, like the war, racism, homophobia, injustice. It made you mad, which is a skill only good authors have.This book went in so many ways I wasn't expecting, which just made it all the better. Had not been for school I definitely would've finished this in like 3 days. I could not put it downnn!!! A friend recommended it to me and I'm SO glad she did, this review took so long to get out because I had to process my feelings for this book.------ The ROMANCE ------AUYGFDGHF KATH AND LILY&gt;&gt;&gt; THEIR ROMANCE IS EVERYTHING IM GOING TO SCREAMif anyone has songs or a playlist based off these two PLEASE tell me!!The way they met was incredible, THE SLOWBURN incredible, the heartbreak the EVERYTHING.I love them for each other “She wondered where Kath was. She wondered if Kath could sense her, sitting here on this train as it took her away. Perhaps it was possible, if she closed her eyes and sent out her thoughts along the steel track like a message along a telegraph wire.I love you. I love you."AUUUUFDFSSFGFHGJ. they hurt me in all the best ways------ Things I disliked ------Okay, this is the biggest reason this book isn't 5 stars:The flashbacks.I loved them, don't get me wrong. For most of the book they were exciting to read, as they were giving depth to the adults in the book, which doesn't happen often. The only problem was that the author barely did anything with that depth. Like Joseph's major PTSD, judy's miscarriage, big stuff like that seemed to have no effect in the present. And it helped with some parts with the mother, but Idk, it just didn't help, and made me bored at some points knowing they didn't lead up to anything,Overall, I still loved the book------ QUOTES ------“She’s having a hard time right now because you’re not what she expected. But we’re never what our parents expected. They have to learn that lesson.”"Lily stroked her hand over Kath's hair tenderly, feeling impossibly close to her. How precious she was, and how miraculous.""There was probably a scientific explanation for it, but the older she got, the more she was inclined to give into the the feeling that these moments were glimpses into a world greater than this physical one. It was as if there were cycles that repeated themselves over and over, but most people never saw the repetition; they were too deeply enmeshed in their own path to see.”-----Extra------queer people   Um dos romances queer mais empolgantes e importantes deste século é como está descrito na contracapa, com tantos elogios e prémios eu temia que este livro pudesse ser demasiado pretensioso. Contudo a história é exatamente como a vendem, um relato extraordinário sobre uma rapariga sino americana que tenta encontrar o seu lugar no mundo. Na América dos anos 50, a homossexualidade é ilegal e mesmo esta comunidade já podendo possuir os seus próprios bares noturnos não deixava de haver represálias para estas pessoas que eram vistas como transgressoras e doentes. A nossa protagonista Lily, é filha de imigrantes chineses que lutaram muito para possuir a sua cidadania americana mas estão em risco de serem deportados, pelo pai médico ter atendido um estudante que suspeita-se ser comunista. A protagonista tenta não sair do caminho traçado pelos seus pais, mantendo sempre as mesmas amizades que mesmo tóxicas pertencem ao mesmo meio social de Lily. Apenas quando decide aproximar-se de Kath, ela pode sentir-se um pouco mais livre e parar de negar os seus verdadeiros desejos. Mas o facto de Lily admitir que é lésbica terá consequências, não apenas para ela e Kath mas toda a sua família. "Ontem á noite no Telegraph Club" é um dos romances jovem adultos melhor contextualizados que li. Todo o ambiente em volta de São Francisco, do bairro de Chinatown e do Telegraph Club é inebriante. Assim como a tensão entre os americanos e os chineses, acreditando que estes são responsáveis pelo comunismo. Num mundo que está perto de alcançar os primeiros projetos espaciais, em que Lily pretende fazer parte de um grupo de matemáticas que ajudam na luta da conquista do espaço. Este foi daquelas histórias que gostaria de preservar mais um pouco, sofri e sorri com as escolhas de Lily.   Cały czas bałam się i spodziewała się momentu, kiedy homofobia lat 50. spadnie na główne bohaterki całą mocą przemocy w postaci co najmniej obrażeń fizycznych lub lobotomii. Takiego momentu nie było - owszem, homofobia jest wszechobecna, dławiąca, atakuje ze strony aparatów państwowych i instytucji rodzinnych, ale zostaje miejsce na oddech, czy to w Klubie Telegraph, gdzie można być sobą czy w relacji głównych bohaterek, która rozkwita na nieprzychylnym gruncie. Moment konfrontacji jest zadziwiająco współczesny, chociaż przesiąknięty stereotypami tego okresu - rolami płciowymi, czy przekonaniem, że lesbijki żyją i umierają samotnie jako wyrzutki społeczne - bo te stereotypy wciąż żyją i te argumenty powtarzają się niezmiennie od pół wieku, nieważne, jak bardzo są głupie i nieprawdziwe (bo homofobia jest głupia i fantazmatyczna). Z jednej strony doceniam, że dziewczyny mają szansę na szczęśliwe życie, bo takie historie też się pojawiają w queerowej historii i to od zawsze, dobrze przypomnieć, że nawet w do cna homofobicznym społeczeństwie można żyć - z trudem i pomimo, ale można - i być szczęśliwym. Przemocowe tragiczne queerowe historie z lat 50. łatwo znaleźć, bo wpisują się w popkulturowe schematy. Z drugiej strony, lęki, które dopadały mnie w trakcie lektury nie wzięły się znikąd - po części winne temu wspomniane schematy, po części sama struktura powieści, gdzie ten strach wisi nad główną bohaterką i jest uzasadniony. W efekcie powieść nie ma punktu kulminacyjnego, bo emocjonalne napięcie nie zostaje rozładowane tylko się rozmywa. Pojawia się gdzieś na drugim planie, w formie rajdu policyjnego na klub. Może gdybyśmy czytali to z punktu widzenia Katie byłoby inaczej. Powieść jest świetnie napisana, klimatyczna, pełna szczegółów, które sprawiają, że dana epoka i miejsce stają się realne - odniesień do popkultury (utopijne science fiction!), aktualnych wydarzeń, trendów społecznych (strach przed komunistami, państwowy apart opresji, rasizm tej epoki). Lily jest pełnowymiarową postacią, podobnie jak wszyscy, którzy ją otaczają. Powieść żyje i wciąga czytelnika w swój świat. Zdecydowanie warta polecenia powieść o queerowym dorastaniu.   Things are not great for queer people now but they are better than they were 70yrs ago, in the US anyway. And as things get better, I sometimes feel like we're losing queer history. And so often I feel that historical stories of queer people of color are rarely told. This is the story of a queer Chinese American girl coming of age in 1950s US. And for that reason, I give this book 3 stars, because it's important to tell stories like these.Unfortunately though, even though the content here is important, this book is not very well done. There are dozens of plot threads - Lily’s adventures at The Telegraph Club, her budding relationship with Kath, her fracturing relationship with best friend Shirley, Shirley's involvement with a young man associated with the Communist party, law enforcement threatening Lily’s father's citizenship, and more.More than that though, this book has random POV switches and alternating timelines. We spend most of our time with Lily in the 1950s, but we also visit with Lily’s mother in the 1930s and Lily’s father in 1940s. And while I suppose it's interesting to gain insight into Lily’s parents’ lives, what we learn from these POV switches doesn't advance the story or contribute to the plot. These are just two more of the dozens of plot threads.As a result, this story is unfocused. It's trying to examine too many things at once. And these dozens of plot threads are not brought together in one cohesive story by the end of the book. Additionally, because this is not a romance, I wasn't expecting a typical romance style HEA, but I was expecting a more hopeful ending. Instead the ending is left completely open. What direction will Lily’s life take? What's next for her? For Kath? Will Lily have the courage to live an authentic life? We'll never know.There's a worthwhile story in these pages, but it's difficult to draw it out and, in the end, I wanted just a little bit more - something more cohesive and something more conclusive.  Exquisite historical fiction novel with the vibrant setting of 1950s where San Francisco comes alive, Lily a Chinese American girl has her queer awakening.“Love was the justification for all her secrets, but it also made her vulnerable. And Lily understood.”This was such a thought provoking story, I could feel the atmosphere of the telegraph club ( THE CINEMATIC ENERGY), and the struggle of accepting your identity but at the same time feeling the thrill of it. I WAS TRANSPORTED INTO THE TELEGRAPH CLUB, RUNNING IN THE STREETS, AND CHINATOWN. The representation of asian historical queer woman... you could JUST TELL it was researched and well written. OFC I loved Kath and Lily their romance was soft and tender because they were figuring out how to love with all society pining down on them, though we didn't get a lot of expansion on their love story the connection still felt deep. The ¨coming out ¨ conversations was admirable because of her new found loyalty to who she is and who she loves! I literally have 0 negative comments apart from the switch of POVs to her family story that I personally felt didn't have a relation with the story and interrupted the flow, so I wouldn't consider this a favorite book but it is up there. ¨She felt a queer giddiness overtaking her, as if her body might float up from the ground because she was so buoyant with this lightness, this love.”  not much to say now except how this cover takes my breathe away and the whole story was perfectt  I loved everything about this book - even the flashbacks! I think Malinda Lo weaved a beautiful, powerful and engaging story using strong Asian women. This book follows Lily, a 17-year-old girl living in San Fran in the era of red-scare paranoia in 1954. She's coming to terms with her sexuality, and we follow her as she experiences new aspects of what this means for her. Her mother and aunt have small flashback chapters, and I came to really enjoy them as they gave a different perspective of their experience of being an Asian American woman in that era. Historical fiction is one of those genres for me that I don't typically seek out, but usually really enjoy. An added benefit to this historical fiction novel is that this had sapphic themes, and I loved the characters development - both Lily and Kath's. I highly recommend a read and I can't wait to read Last Night at the Telegraph Club's companion novel, A Scatter of Light.  A coming-of-age story of first love and self discovery, Last Night at the Telegraph Club expertly explores the danger and fear for both queer and Chinese individuals during the 1950's in the US, whilst showing how even that fear and danger can't change a persons identity or who they are at the core. Whilst I loved the historical elements to the story, Lily and Kath's relationship and Lily's journey of self discovery, I did find that the pacing was a little too slow for my taste. That being said, this was an incredibly moving, enlightening and well researched read and one of which I could feel the love, heart and care Malinda Lo put into every page. TW: racism, homophobia, xenophobia, racist and homophobic slurs.   This book was absolutely magnificent and beautiful, and it made me cry. One of my favorite reads of the year so far. GAY GAY GAY! YES IM GOING TO EAT THIS UP💪 lesbian space girls have my whole heart 🥹 it's annoying how i can relate to her relationship with her parents and its complication, and i want MORE! i just want to see lilykath happy, please 2.75*TW: homophobia, sexism, racism, manipulationthis was way too long for me and didn't like the ending :( 4.75* 4.5🌟 actual rating: 4.5 starsLILY:☾ chemical sets &gt; dolls; pants &gt; skirts☾ restricted by society as she can’t be who she truly want to be and can’t openly love who she loves.☾ suffocating social expectations of being a Chinese: studious and enter college, only dream she can have is to marry and have kids. career? don’t even think about it.KATHLEEN:☾ dream to be a pilot☾ doesn’t let anyone talk her down from what she wants or belittle her.the romance builds up slowly. most of the time it was lily realising and coming to terms with her attraction towards females.in this time period, women are only taught to settle down and become a mother but not to pursue their aspirations. however, both lily and kathleen have plans that defies the patriarchy and the stereotypical viewpoint that women shouldn’t ask for more. in this aspect, Malinda Lo also showed the other side through lily’s best friend, shirley’s point of view where she wants check all the boxes of a traditional Chinese girl.as a Chinese, i was partially excited that when certain dialogue weren’t written in english but mandarin chinese. the other part of me is worried that i’ve let my Mother Tongue deteriorate so badly that i couldn’t recognise a word. Malinda Lo made a decision to write in traditional romanised Chinese which meant that i would only recognise at least 50% of every sentence that’s in Chinese. better than scoring 0%.there are a few chapters in between the different parts of the book that is narrated in the perspective of the older generation namely lily’s parents and aunt depicting their experiences from many years ago. most of the perspectives surrounded the time period during WWII. it was really sweet to read how grace and joseph, lily’s parents, met, joseph’s PTSD after the war, and aunt judy’s trips out with young lily.after treating a patient who is supposedly a part of a communist group, lily’s father is on the verge of deportation back to China when he refused to sign a statement that might scapegoat a young man. this was consistently behind my mind while lily’s is out exploring a new world, that is outside of Chinatown. the politics within the book is directly related to how it was like in real life then. it’s such a tense situation. as Malinda Lo addressed in her author’s note, 1950s focused on “conformity and social expression” but was also “a time of transition and thus great cultural anxiety that was often expressed in efforts to suppress difference.”p.s. i like lin yang paau more than tau sha paau too.  "Every so often I stop reading to stare at the cover because it's so beautiful." - me obsessing over the cover of this book for probably the 15th time that day because loOK AT IT (thank goodness the story was absolutely fantastic too otherwise I wouldn't have known what to do with myself)  Oh good gosh it’s a YA of Butch/femme history, a Chinese American girl lead, and powerfully written. What’s not to absolutely drool over?? „[...] lily stumbled over the word homosexual. why did it have to sound so obscene, lily thought, the x crushed wetly in the back of her mouth.“i apologise for choosing such a depressing quote, but upon immediately rereading some of my favourite passages after finishing, there simply were too many options to choose from and i can‘t be bothered to make a more fitting decision; i’m pretty sure this is now my favourite lesbian coming-of-age novel. lily‘s story is obviously vastly different from my own experience, with it being set in 1950's san francisco, her family‘s fear of deportation constantly looming over her family and red-scare paranoia threatening her chinese american community - but malinda lo managed to perfectly put into words the most alienating, indescribable, almost weird aspects of first coming to terms with being a lesbian. feeling like everyone can see right through you and the shame that comes with it; knowing deep down that your attraction to women is vastly different from that of your local misogynistic straight man, but being unable to articulate why and how; feeling predatory for even the most tender emotions just because of who they‘re directed at.despite how tragic i‘m making this novel sound, it is bursting with hope and affirmation. the setting of chinatown in the fifties and especially the lesbian bar lily is taken to by her friend (yes, the infamous telegraph club) felt incredibly vibrant and authentic, and good god, i wish tommy andrews was real because i’d kill to see her perform live. naturally, there is a love story in here, and it is just as beautiful as it is heartbreaking at times, but at its core, last night at the telegraph club is about lily and lily’s journey alone - her love interest obviously vastly influences her life from the second they first interact and especially after their first visit to the telegraph club, but the romance gets to share the spotlight with the stunning exploration of lily‘s complicated relationships with each of her family members, interspersed with short flashbacks into their personal history, relationships, and experiences with immigration. looking back, there were a few plot points that were left unresolved or underdeveloped and i understand how some readers could take issue with the aprupt ending, but it honestly just didn‘t bother me enough to impact my overall opinion. i am nothing if not inconsistent when it comes to my how nit-picky i am. i'm aware this review was all over the place, but all i really wanted to get across is that i desperately hope this novel gets the recognition i believe it deserves. i certainly will be screaming my love for it from the rooftops, and i‘m sure i will come back to it for a reread or two fairly soon. &lt;3  3.5 ⭐️TW/CW:  homophobia, racism, manipulation, mention of miscarriage, alcohol I will start by saying that the queer asian representation in a historical setting was great, and I think that so many people will absolutely enjoy this. I think most of my issues with the book were that the interactions between characters at times felt very childish and petty, but that also comes from me reading a lot more adult books this year and that is just a personal preference that has developed.Lily and Kath: I really enjoyed the way they came to accept and show their feelings, how the small touches and looks just grew into something more. How they strived to be themselves in a world that insisted on hating them, be that their race, or their feelings. Life was definitely not easy for them. I feel like this book was very slow, but the setting was incredible and really well written. Lily felt very naive for most of this book, I would have definitely liked to understand her with a little more depth, but I definitely think she contributed a lot to the juvenile feeling that I was getting for most of the book. And with Kath I feel like we hardly get to know her, I would have loved some POV's from her side of the story. Overall I think it was a quick read, with a good story, but it ended up a little underwhelming for me.   The way this book presents Lily's initial curiosity and then her percolating discovery is spot-on and so sweet. It portrays the innocence and the blooming excitement (and early ambivalence). Lo crafts this beautifully in its emotional and psychological trajectory (please see my highlights).I thought the book was affecting in profound ways. It is a perfect "coming of age" type of book because it feels so intimate. Think "Killing Me Softly."Of course, Lo's setting is important. She has captured San Francisco so well. Lo names Chinese Hospital, Galileo, Chinese American Citizens Alliance (est 1895), Vesuvio's, etc. All these and others are still there. She describes St. Peter and Paul Church and Macys. Those who have lived or worked in this area will know North Beach and Portsmouth Square; and in this book, you'll revisit them.As importantly, in her Author's Note, Lo gives the history of Chinese Americans (whose initial immigration formed today's US immigration law and policies). She describes in clear and accessible language what brings us to current anti-Asian violence which was here before Covid but exacerbated by it. I especially appreciated how she shares this information.I was not pleased with her use of Chinese characters and how it's sprinkled throughout with footnotes to define them. Both seemed unnecessary. I know it can be powerful but here (and given Lo's explanation) it was inconsistent and irritatingly distracting. Her romanization was wonky in her attempt to recreate its use from the 1950s.Overall, this is a masterful story of how a young woman finds herself, in her family and in her world.[And I'll add that I braced myself near the end because I've been so used to a certain unfortunate trope in queer stories where one of the partners has to die at the end (This trope is part of a twisted and outdated morality tale.) Lo didn't resurrect it but I couldn't help but prepare for it.]P.S. Lo was very kind to share this playlist on a Zoom session when I asked. She had noted some songs were thinly coded as queer. Just fascinating:https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3qz...  the romance in this book was absolutely adorable, i really loved both of the characters, however i do think Last Night at the Telegraph Club is less a romance than it is the journey of a seventeen-year-old Chinese American girl coming to terms with her sexuality in the particularly harsh context of America in the '50s. there actually aren't that many scenes between Lily, the main character, and Kath, the love interest, and i wish there were because the two of them were really cute together! but i also feel like showing every other aspect of the lesbian experience in San Francisco, especially everything that had to do with the Telegraph Club, was fascinating and necessary! this is why i love reading historical fiction. also, the author's note really added to the experience, it was so interesting to read and it definitely shouldn't be ignored! the reason this doesn't get 5 stars is the pacing of the story, honestly. it was quite slow and i found a couple of chapters boring—for lack of a better word—to the point where i had to skim through some passages. i know the chapters about Lily's parents and aunt served a purpose, but i was honestly able to comprehend the plot and the stakes without them... it just felt like they slowed things down even more. and then, suddenly, the end of the book felt super rushed? which is already annoying on its own, but if you add it to how slow the rest was, it creates a certain unevenness i didn't particularly like.   This book was so well crafted, Malinda Lo is truly talented. Her ability to create a story based off the laws, experiences, and world events during the 50s was fantastic. Every detail was there, the politics, the discrimination and prejudice. It was so well written, I was legitimately transported into the story, which was a good and bad thing. On one hand, everything was so vivid. On the other, so many of the events in the book were upsetting to read and feeling so connected to the story made me visibly upset, frustrated and angry on the behalf of, or along with the characters.I loved the time jumps. Not many authors pull them off well in a way that isn’t confusing. But Malinda Lo did fantastic. It provided information about character’s pasts and how it applies to the present. The only thing I wish is that there was more romance between Kath and Lily, they had a few scenes but I would’ve loved some other cute moments as well!Overall so fantastic, a book I would recommend to anyone.  4.5 stars.Wow. This book was incredibly well done. It was immediately apparent that Malinda Lo really did her research. This book follows Lily Hu's story, a 17 year old girl growing up in 1950s Chinatown, and her first venture into San Francisco's lesbian scene with her first love Kath. This was a very touching story. Malinda Lo weaves the two themes of the book, growing up lesbian and growing up Chinese during a time when neither were well-accepted in America, effortlessly and masterfully. I thought they they were incredibly well-balanced throughout the book. The characters, along with Lily's experience of feeling alone and unsure while discovering her sexuality, felt very realistic and relatable. I absolutely adored this book.  A wonderful historical fiction novel about a Chinese teen girl exploring and identifying with becoming a lesbian. San Francisco 1950's was when gay rights were not recognised yet and the LGBT community were heavily chastised against celebrating their identity, which makes it a tough set up for Lily recognising these feelings within herself. She sneaks out of her house to explore the Telegraph Club, a lesbian nightclub and realises that there are others like her. I really enjoyed Lily and Kath's relationship and how they realised that they each had feelings for each other, it was really companionable and slow burn.

Last Night at the Telegraph ClubBy Malinda LoChinese-American Queer historical fiction San Francisco ChinatownSet in the 1950's Red ScareAn incredible and beautifully well-written and well-researched novel set in San Francisco during the red scare. It is a story about immigration, culture, identity and one of blemished part of our American history. I thought that the relationship and the characters were so well written, my heart was about to burst. This is a true gem of a book and as a historical fiction lover and lover of YA books, this combination with the queer love story was a winner. I cannot recommend this enough.  a mediocre 3 stars.on paper this is something i should've loved: a character study on a queer woman's journey to self-discovery, dealing with homophobia and racism during the 1950s - and yet i just couldn't get into it, i don't know why, i think i just don't vibe with Lo's writing. the first half of the novel (about 200 pages, mind you) felt as if i was constantly waiting for something to happen - which it was, i know, it just didn't feel like it. and then during the last part it finally got interesting, exciting!... and then it ended.i wish i liked it, i really do.  This book was 100 pages too long. Just so much extraneous description of rooms and celebrations, and outfits, and a trip to see seals.It had so much potential. But alas, so many dropped threads, so many gaps, so many dull moments. You're left dangling on virtually all of the interesting bits, muttering to yourself "but what happened with... (long list here ... deportation, communism, discrimination, the missing year, her career dreams, her friend, her ex-friend, the Telegraph Club??)".So disappointing.  4.5Is there anything I would change? Yes, mainly the pacing and/or plot. But I love this book for what it is. I really appreciate the perspective of being Chinese and American and lesbian in the 50s when Lily wasn’t accepted by all the communities she was a part of. And I’m sure this can still be an ongoing issue in 2021. This book hit very close to home and I’m so glad I read this. Also, all the Cantonese dialogues and the food and the thorough research? Extra extra extra brownie points.  *me coming to Goodreads to add a sapphic Chinese historical fiction to my TBR and seeing I already did so wayyyy back in 2017* 🥰🥰Anyway, I stan this cover WONDERFUL!!!! Historical queer love story set in 1950s Chinatown. ❤️The lengthy author’s note is amazing and full of important history.HS and adult collections.  4.5 starsHow could I not pick this up with that gorgeous cover art??? Ma, znate šta - evo 5 zvezdica!! Jako mi se dopalo i konačno jedna istorijska romansa napisana kako treba. 4.5/5 🥺🥺 I am going to start this review w a paraphrased quote from a friend about it: It is like getting to watch your younger sister come to terms with her sexuality and discover she is gay, and it is amazing. I agree with this sentiment, and yet reading Lily was a reflection of my own journey of discovery and the feelings of shame, acceptance and everything in between. While my experience was no where near what Lily’s was, there is a sense of closeness I tend to feel with young, queer, female characters.Malinda Lo is a genius—to put it simply. It is so obvious the time and care she put into crafting this book on all fronts. The topics of race, sexuality, familial ties all artfully tied into a story…not necessarily a happy one at all times, but one that truly makes you feel things. Lo’s writing genuinely transported me to the scenes of this book. I was in class watching the secret shared glances between Kath and Lily. I was walking on the street with them at midnight. I was in the Telegraph Club, sitting at a cramped table, able to smell Tommy’s cologne mixed with cigarettes and alcohol. I was there for all of it. That is not something I feel happens too often anymore. When the question “if you could live in any decade which would you choose?” Is posed, I feel i frequently hear the 50s as an answer. I can understand why… the clothes, the music, this feeling of security between wars. That was what the movies made us feel the 50s were like… and for heterosexual white people. The 50s were anything but secure and serene for people of color and members of the LGBT+ community. That is why the setting of this novel is so important. There are jarring moments that genuinely made me stop and think about privileges I hold with my identities. Queer white tears are a real thing, and it is important to remember that yes, queer people are discriminated against and always have been, but, white queer people have an exponential amount of privilege that I feel is often attempted to be left behind so as to appear as victims (not sure if this is making sense tbh). This book, being focused around a queer woman of color, is super important in the conversation around intersectionality. Why it is so important to remember that we can have privileged and marginalized identities and how to appropriately acknowledge them. I am starting to sound like my RA class advisor, so I will leave you with a few quotes that I adored for one reason or another.-“How precious she was, and how miraculous”-“But part of her realized there was something delicious about prolonging this moment, an intolerable pause before they kissed”-“Boys and girls, men and women, smiling at each other or talking animatedly, hands touching, unafraid to be seen together”-“My mother said there are no homosexuals in our family” 	“Maybe there aren’t, but there might be a lesbian”Now off you all go to read this wonderfully heartbreaking &amp; splendid book!!!  A fantastic historical fiction and a MUST read for asian lgbt+! I love learning about history best through historical fiction, and this book is no exception. So many relatable feelings and experiences in this book. I also felt like the characters were very true to their ages in terms of how they spoke/carried themselves. The small reasons it isn’t a 5 is I didn’t really like the flashbacks for minor characters? It didn’t add anything to the story for me. It got long winded at some parts and establishing that Shirley is a terrible friend was accomplished REALLY early on. Shirley didn’t need to be expanded on quite so much!Overall I love this and am happy I read it for my pride month reads!  *4.4 (i know i’m specific) Overall this was such a great read and I was really invested. You can tell the author went into detail on research for the 1950s and what was happening to Asians, queer people, and the government during this time. The romance between the two girls was so cute and Lily realizing her sexuality was 😭😭. Definitely a great read  this book felt like an intense rollercoaster of highs and lows but i throughly enjoyed all of it !! the history aspect was such a creative touch that just made the book more engaging. went from crying to smiling like an idiot in no time but im so glad it ended on a high ❤️‍🩹 A very solid and important read. This was the perfect book for Amelchen and me to read together: it perfectly combined her love for historical fiction with my love for pretty words and queer stories and I often found myself daydreaming about Lily and Kath and wondering how their story would end ❤️ malinda lo, you are a genius.  I'm not okay. 4.5 stars but yeah i deffo get the hype now Piękne to było, ale jakoś nie czułam więzi na początku. Od połowy byłam bardzo ciekawa, a sama końcówka&gt;&gt;&gt; nie mogłam oderwać się od ostatnich 100 stron. Wspaniałe, przemyślane, just… masterpiece✨ A capa é magnífica e também gostei da história embora quisesse mais, porquê é apenas um aperitivo da vida daquelas pessoas. 3 starsI was really looking forward to reading this one because I have been meaning to read something by Malinda Lo for ages. I’m really glad I picked this one up!!While I didn’t really mesh with Malinda Lo’s writing style, I really enjoyed the story. I thought it was incredibly atmospheric and the atmosphere came across really well in the writing. I really liked the main character and I thought her self-discovery journey was written really well and handled with a lot of nuance. I wasn’t as invested in the romance, but it didn’t feel like it was meant to be the central element of the story, anyway, so I didn’t mind it too much. I really enjoyed the exploration of family dynamics!! It was really interesting to see how Lily interacted with different members of her family and how much thought she put into it. I also really enjoyed seeing how those dynamics developed. When it comes to the friendships, I wanted a little more exploration of the friendship between Lily and Shirley, but I get that there wasn’t really enough time for that, given everything else that was going on in the book. I thought the setting and the plot were both really well done!! I feel like I learned a lot about the dynamics in 1950s San Francisco and I’m now v interested in picking up nonfiction about it because I’m very intrigued by a lot of the elements that were included in this book. I also thought the plot functioned really well as a reflection of the historical setting and I really enjoyed how Lo let the two play off each other. Overall, I think this was a really well-written book and one that’s definitely easy to lose yourself in!! For the most part, it was a very enjoyable experience for me and I would definitely recommend it to others!!trigger warnings: period typical lesbophobia, homophobia, racism (all mostly unchallenged in text); references to miscarriagerep: Chinese-American lesbian MC, lesbian LI, Chinese &amp; Chinese-American SCs, sapphic SCs  even though there are plenty of things i enjoyed while reading this i think it deserves 4 stars merely because it actually helped me get out of a severe reading slump so that’s that im sad that this book didnt live up to the expectations i had. it fell kinda flat, especially with kath's character :( 4.5 stars (RTC) i sad AAAAHHHHHHHHHHH Check out my Amazon book recommendations reading vlog for my full thoughts on Last Night at the Telegraph Club: https://youtu.be/VUzKaHJRWxwI really really liked this!! The Telegraph Club was such an interesting setting. I loved learning about it with Lily and Kath! This book felt like I was watching a movie. I was so immersed in the setting, and Kath and Lily felt so tangible that it felt as if I were hanging out with them. The book was a tad less interesting towards the middle, but the beginning and end were very strong. I also wish some parts of the book were explored more, but overall this was a really beautiful story about further understanding yourself.  A sweet and important story with the most vivid descriptions and details. I can overlook one or two discrepancies because it‘s a beautiful novel that will definitely stick with me. 4.5 stars  3.5 stars* I really liked the writing and the historical undertones but I found it a bit boring. It did pick up after page 250. 3.7/5 - Shirley was not it. One of the best queer YA novels I’ve ever read. It didn’t feel like the typical LGBTQ+ YA (which isn’t a dig at YA because I do enjoy the genre), but because of the historical context, Lily was dealing with intense feelings and problems that felt like bigger stakes than the typical contemporary novel. Malinda Lo does a beautiful job weaving in time period details and I could picture San Francisco so vividly and smell all the delicious food she described. I also really appreciated all of the research she did and I’m definitely going to check out the sources about the night clubs.This is a book that hit me right in the feelings. Even though my coming of age experience was very different from Lily’s I related so much to feeling the need to hide or be afraid of my queerness when I first discovered it as a teen. The intersectional LGBTQ+ experience is something that gets overlooked, and queer YA books tend to focus on the white experience, making Last Night at the Telegraph Club all the more vital and rich. Lily’s experience as an American who is only seen as Chinese first despite being born in San Francisco only adds to her difficulty of occupying white queer spaces. She’s objectified and treated like a foreigner by many of the other white lesbian characters. At the heart of all this, is a story of first love that starts slowly and blooms into something very beautiful and real.I’m looking forward to discussing this with A Novel Bunch Booksta Club this month.I also can’t wait for the companion novel A Scattering of Light, which will be set in 2013 during the Supreme Court decision regarding gay marriage.  it took me far too long to finish this book, but it was genuinely so good. the last 70 or so pages flew by, and while it wasn’t your stereotypical “everything works out” happy ending, it was realistic and it made sense for the plot of the book. genuinely enjoyed it and this was probably one of the best ya books i have read in a long time.updated bc i do think i have to report on the fact that it was kinda hard for me to get through  I received an advance copy from the publisher via Edelweiss. This in no way influences my review; all words, thoughts, and opinions are my own.Actual rating: 4.5Content notes:🌃 assimilation🌃 brief mention of sexual innuendo from adult men towards teen girls🌃 gendered idea of acceptable interests🌃 shame, guilt🌃 masturbation🌃 heteronormativity🌃 xenomisia, anti-Chinese racist remark🌃 threat of deportation🌃 newspaper article exotifying Chinese women🌃 reference to Japanese internment camps 🌃 solicitation of minors🌃 N*gros used as racial descriptor 🌃 flashbacks, surgery description🌃 alcohol consumption, underage alcohol consumption, inebriation🌃 mention of queer tragedy in media, suicide in movie🌃 mention of bar raids🌃 use of d*kes as identifying language (in community)🌃 Chinese char called “China doll” as nickname(?)🌃 on page sex (moderate explicitness)🌃 bar raid🌃 recollection of miscarriage🌃 feelings of guilt over not being drawn to motherhood in “right” way🌃 queermisic newspaper article, scare tactics🌃 parental denial at coming out, “you’re too young to know”🌃 face slapped by parentA quiet and slow historical fiction with a soft lesbian romance - I really enjoyed this book! Full review closer to release.Full review:This book is so quiet and slow that the emotions reading it just creep up on you.Lily Hu is a seventeen-year-old Chinese American living in San Francisco and doing her best to be a good Chinese daughter - good grades, good friends, and deference to her parents. But when she comes across an advertisement for a male impersonator, she starts to realize why she's never been interested in a boy before. When classmate Kath happens upon the advertisement in Lily's book, she tells her she's been to the club, The Telegraph Club, before, and invites Lily along next time she goes. What follows is a slow self realization and a slow romance.This book fills my heart with so much happiness and feelings. I've tried reading Malinda Lo's older books, but hadn't had much luck - I'm so glad that this book and I clicked so well. I love the exploration of identity and Lily trying to figure out where she fits as the only Asian-American in most lesbian spaces and as a lesbian in most Chinese spaces.This book definitely isn't all shiny things and doesn't shy away from some of the darker and sadder parts of 1950s USA. There are discussions and mentions of how many LGTBQ people would be sent to asylums by their family to "cure" them, mentions of bar raids and bribing the police, and the prevalence of queer stories with tragic endings. But amidst these heartbreaking mentions, I feel like this is also a book of community and hope. It shows how queer spaces were a space for people to be themselves and also allowed them to find others with similar experiences. I loved seeing how chosen and found family is such a prevalent part of queer history, a way to find a home even with the family of blood isn't willing to accept all parts of your truth.I really enjoyed this book and definitely recommend it if you're interested in a quiet historical YA with a lesbian Chinese American protagonist working through her identity and the expectations of those she loves. And the romance between her and Kath was so sweet. There are scenes full of tension where they're both so desperate to touch, to kiss, but the location isn't safe for them, and that mix of desire and fear is so visceral and relatable. And I promise - the ending is not a tragic one!  This was such a lovely YA historical fiction read! When it comes to themes of identity, it takes on quite a lot -- our main character is a wonderful exploration of what it meant to be Chinese American and queer in the 1950s. I think Malinda Lo took on a difficult task and did a wonderful job of it. While the setting is fun and lively, the plot itself is fairly straightforward. The power of the story largely lies in the MC's introspection and the hidden world (of the Telegraph Club) that slowly unfurls to her. I think this book will appeal to many, including fans of Kristin Lambert's The Boy in the Red Dress!Thank you Penguin Teen for providing an e-galley through Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.  I'm waffling between 3 and 4 stars for this one. 3 is probably fair. Last Night at the Telegraph Club is a YA historical novel about a Chinese-American teenage lesbian in San Francisco in the 1950s. It was written by Malinda Lo, and is an expanded version of a short story she wrote for the All Out anthology, "New Year." "New Year" was by far my favorite story in the All Out collection, so I had extremely high hopes for this book, which... went somewhat unfulfilled. Don't get me wrong, it's still a solid read, but I wanted to like it way more than I actually did. I think part of the issue came from adapting a short story into a full-length novel. "New Year" felt brief, enticing, thrilling, while Last Night at the Telegraph Club felt slow and lagging. There's not a lot of action. The lead characters, Lily and her love interest Kath, don't do much beyond repeatedly sneak out at night to visit a lesbian bar [the aforementioned Telegraph Club]. The first two visits WERE a real thrill, but by the time we get to the third and fourth visit, it's like... hold up, are we gonna spend the entire book here?? The second issue with the novel lies with the romantic interest, Kath, who did not appear in the original story "New Year." She's a new addition for the book version. Guys, don't hate me for this, but Kath is pretty bland. There's nothing actually wrong with her, but she's just... colorless. Colorless, and maybe a little too "nice." No bite, no tang, nothing unexpected or surprising about her character. I'm not saying I need Kath to be some devil-may-care heartbreaker, but YOU GOTTA GIVE ME SOMETHING! A little friction goes a long way to igniting a Spark. I will say Kath and Lily had some good chemistry early in the book, at the very beginning of their slow-burn arc, when they're dancing around each other trying to figure out their attraction. The scene in the Chinese ice cream shop was particularly lovely--soft and warm and gentle. But by the time we get to the climactic chapters, their first kiss, their first time, etc., the slow burn has dragged on to the point where the chemistry has mostly fizzled out. Ironically, then, the "spiciest" scene in the book is the not the sex scene. It's the scene in the first couple chapters where Lily is in the drugstore skimming through a cheap lesbian novel, desperately hoping the clerk won't notice her reading this erotic, scandalous story of the love between two women, and Feeling Feelings She's Never Felt Before, in the best tradition of all closeted queer kids from culturally homophobic backgrounds since time immemorial. That scene was FIRE. It was tense, it was electric, it was thrilling, it was full of possibility. I was all "more of this, please!!!" but we never really got more of it. In the end, I enjoyed Last Night at the Telegraph Club as an exploration of queer female spaces in San Francisco in the 1950s, but I would have liked more tension, higher stakes, and a faster pace.  This book was wonderful in every single way. Would recommend to literally everyone. I wish I could read fifty more stories about these characters and 1950s queer San Francisco ♥ I want a second book or a 1.5 sequel !!!!!!!!!!! Sweetest gay book I’ve ever read 🥺 This is really great at developing interesting, nuanced interpersonal dynamics—but then leaving them underdeveloped, for some reason. When the book ended I actually thought it was a mistake. Where is the actual resolutions to her mothers flashbacks or what happens with Cindy. I forgot the protagonist even had siblings and a wider family beyond her own until the end of the story, when they become pertinent and appear. There feels like one crisis and obstacle was inserted and then the resolution, and then, much like the end of a Hitchcock film, the credits rolled. I feel like I could have spent double the audio time with the story and felt satiated, which is a compliment to the flow and qualities of the writing that work. Though, because it is YA, sometimes the dialogue and how explicit everything has to be, is kind of annoying—I still undoubtedly wanted to spend more time with everyone. And kind of expected there to be a lot more about where the homophobia actually comes from, but it is elided. The author clearly did a lot of research, she says as much in the afterward of the audiobook, which was well narrated. It’s a shame not more of it made it into the actual book, imo.  I really enjoyed this book a lot. It painted such a vivid picture of 1950s San Francisco - especially Chinatown and the gay scene. It was incredibly immersive, I could imagine the walk from Lily's house to the Telegraph club. I was gripped from the beginning, especially with Lily cutting out images from newspapers of women who didn't conform to traditional gender expectations of the era. There's something really comforting about historical lgbt+ fiction.And you know, there is period typical homophobia, but I appreciate it so much that overall, this is a positive book with a hopeful ending. It's somehow so reassuring and so lesbian and queer. I loved the afterword so much, I'm so glad the author talked more about the city, the gay nightclubs, and about Chinese Americans in general. All so fascinating, though heartbreaking at the same time.This was my first Malinda Lo book, but it won't be the last for sure!Rep: Chinese-American lesbian main character, lesbian love interest, Chinese and Chinese American side characters, lesbian side characters  4.5 ★
  “Are you like the girls in the book too? Because I think I am.”
No sé cómo hacer esta reseña, en serio, ha sido una lectura hermosa pero a la vez desgarradora, sobre todo llegando al último 30%. Llevo desde el año queriendo leer el libro, pero no me atrevía, hasta que por fin, lo leí. Y sí, me ha gustado, el personaje de Lily se ha robado mi corazón. El libro cuenta la historia de Lily, cuyos padres son inmigrantes chicos, aquí ella comienza a descubrir quién es realmente, sin embargo, para los años 50s, ser homosexual está mal visto, los reprimen e incluso los arrestan. Pero no solo eso, los asiáticos también corren peligro, ya que los están acusando de ser comunistas. Es por ello que Lily se encuentra en un estado de temor e impotencia, de querer decir quién es en verdad, pero a la vez no poder hacerlo por miedo a cómo la tratarán su familia y amigos.No saben la impotencia que sentí en algunos momentos, solamente quería proteger a Lily y hacer entrar en razón a sus padres, felizmente tuvo el apoyo de uno de sus familiares. Me pareció que la autora plasmo muy bien los hechos y transmitió esos sentimientos de angustia al lector, además que se logra empatizar no solo con la protagonista sino también con los otros personajes como Lara o Kath.Lo que me gustó:• Kath, que bella persona, necesito alguien como ella en mi vida.• La ambientación, no había leído antes un libro centrado en la época de la Red Scare.• Toda la representación, me encariñé mucho con los otros personajes, los que ayudaron a Lily.• El personaje de Lily, para la edad y para la época, que agallas tenía.Lo que no me gustó:• Los flashbacks, sé que necesitábamos algo de contexto, pero algunas de esas escenas no las vi muy necesarias.• Dejaron algunos temas inconclusos, como lo de Tommy Andrews, la familia de Lily, qué pasó con Shirley.Last Night at the Telegraph Club es una historia hermosa, y todos deberían leerla.  eye cryd :(((((;; god i love this so much, i think this is my favourite ya book now it’s a feat how malinda lo manages to capture this tenderness in the love story between lily and kath so beautifully, as well as lily’s journey of self discovery surrounding her sexuality. it just felt so innocent, so pure and precious, i wanted to protect her so badly. that being said the author doesn’t shy away from the difficulties that come from being in two marginalised communities, that tough intersection and feeling of not truly belonging. with the micro aggressions that came from predominately white queer spaces, or the sheer denial and homophobia in the chinese community, lily’s struggles and reactions were pretty well tackled, and some parts hit so close to home. kath and lily’s relationship was so genuine and innocent, it felt like it was the two of them against the rest of the world, and malinda lo just wrote this lovely pocket for the two of them to exist. that is one of my favourite things about this book - those quiet moments of them in an alley way under a street lamp, holding each other’s hands under the table, smiling wider just looking at each other, god i love them so much. also, i absolutely love it when ya books weave in the main character’s parents perspective when they were younger. it was really well executed here, what a great way to flesh out the characters and give really nuanced and different takes on the chinese-american experience. there was this connective thread through out their experiences of wanting to belong and fit in as a ‘true american’ And chinese person while being honest to themselves that ties back to lily’s story. this took me forever to finish cause of school but also cause it’s kind of a slow burn, i never really rushed to pick this book back up but the beauty of LNATTC is how it sucks you back into the mood and atmosphere immediately. it’s one of those books where it takes a week to pick it up again but once i do i devour like 50% of it in one go, you know?   I stan Lily and Kath 🥺 TW/CW: racism, xenophobia, homophobia, deportation, abandonment (parental)This first book that made me tear up this year (and that’s a hard feat). This was the queer book I’ve been looking for. It featured many themes that were so well done, especially for a YA novel. Malinda Lo has a way with words truly. The prose and characterization was amazing. I loved watching Lily grow and explore her queerness. There were moments I wanted to fight her parents and her best friend, but the ending was well worth it. It was magical to see such tough subjects done so well and within the historical context. The reader could feel the intentionality of the author throughout the entire journey. I look forward to the sequel. I hope we get to sit in Lily and Kath’s romance a bit more.  actually so beyond obsessed with this book I started this book thinking that it will be a solid 5, but the more I read, the more disappointed and frustrated I was. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad novel, but I expected much more of it.I liked the portrait of the post-war San Francisco in the 1950's as it was really well researched, I also enjoyed Lily's experience as a Chinese American and I rooted for her and Kath.That being said, I have a few problems with the novel, so here we go:1. I don't understand why Lily keeps going back to The Telegraph Club, where people are repeatedly launching racial slurs at her. I don't know what drawns her back there, but whatever this is, it's not believable for me. I understand that Malinda Lo wanted to put more light on the racism in this period of the time but... No, I just don't get this.2. The novel was moving in a snail-like pace and I find some of the plots unnecessary as they didn't bring anything to the whole story. Some were started and didn't go anywhere and this may be the most frustrating.3. Also, I'm upset about underdevelopment of Kath's character. I can't say much about her aside that she liked planes and was a lesbian. I would rather get to know her more, but instead we get more familiar with Shirley who at some point disappeares. 4. There are some plots that are lacking the proper ending and to me, this may be the biggest problem of this book. For example, the threat of Lily's family being deported for Communism gets nowhere, the part with the youth Communist group is also forgotten and the big fuss with the Miss Chinatown contest as well. Why even bring this up then?Overall, there was a potential for this novel to be really interesting wlw story, but in the end it didn't feel too memorable for me.   (Disclaimer: I received this book from Netgalley. This has not impacted my review which is unbiased and honest.) TW: homophobia, racism, miscarriageI knew from the beginning of Last Night at the Telegraph Club that it would break my heart. Lo delivers a book that was destined to appeal to all my soft spots. A Chinese-American space obsessed girl coming to terms with her queer identity while also struggling with her family's future and the growing racism against the Chinese. Not to mention her name is Lily - talk about mind meld! Lily's story is one of feeling out of place, with everything against her. It's about those experiences when we discover language to feelings we never knew had a name. At the same time, Last Night at the Telegraph Club is a story about Lily struggling with her feelings and the growing insecurity of her future. To know that if she were to be public about her queer identity, it could give the government another reason to deport them. How their future depends on her maintaining the status quo. How the government doesn't need an excuse. Lo introduces layers to Last Night at the Telegraph Club by adding POV chapters from Lily's family. It becomes a story about the generational immigrant mentality, about their struggles for security and fears for the future.full review: https://utopia-state-of-mind.com/revi...  i'm speechless to me, this book was distinctly lacking in human touch; it felt more like an exploration of the time period rather than the characters themselves. of course, malinda lo did such an excellent job portraying the 1950s as a time where conformity was not only expected but enforced, and how nonconformity, while powerful, was still mainly tinged with the blaring shade of white. how, in spite of all of this, two girls fell in love.two girls fell in love, and i wish we could have seen how their love blossomed and struggled and, against all odds, persisted - not just as an act of defiance, but just love, in all its tenderness and messiness and passion.i wish we could've seen more of lily and kath - more wide eyes when geeking out over science, more whispers and notes, light touches and smiles - more of the small expressions of love that made their relationship brim with those slivers of unbidden, youthful hope. i wish we could have seen them grow with each other and just be, despite a status quo hell-bent on preventing them to do so. despite my qualms, i am glad this book was written and excited to see what the author writes next.  3.5 stars, I'm waffling on final rating. Lo’s research for this began with the desire to uncover the stories of the lesbians who lived in and around Chinatown in the 1950s, and her dedicated research shines through in the authenticity of the narrative she was able to craft. I just wish I liked it better. I have a firm feeling this is a case of I’m not the audience Lo wrote this book for, in that I am no longer a young adult. There’s plenty of story for me – or anyone – here, thus my indecision of whether to round my 3.5 up or down, but the pacing felt slow to me, and part of that was in the way the layers of the story were laid in, the structures familiar to me now as hallmarks of YA. Which isn’t to say this isn’t well written, the opposite is true. But I can’t make myself give it a higher rating, but I am looking forward to discussing it for #CannonBookClub.Full review: https://faintingviolet.wordpress.com/...  It took me so long to get through this. There was just something about the way this book was written that made it really hard for me to get invested. It feels very much like a day to day life, which for storytelling makes it a bit unusual because at times there was no where specific the story was going. I didn’t have any motivation to continue reading because there was nothing I was waiting for to happen. I didn’t work towards anything. It wasn’t until the last 100 pages that I got invested. I really appreciated what the book tried to do. It was a beautiful glimpse into the life of a Chinese-American lesbian in the 50s. It really made me think back to all the things I knew about those parts of history and added to it. I do have a bit of a hard time with reading about queer history because reading about homophobia can just be really painful.   DNF @ 18%Started strong, slowed down a little and was just barely holding my attention when everything suddenly ramped up and I thought we were about to really settle into the plot. Then it jumped back in time 20 years for a POV from the mother. I was really struggling to care about the new POV and thought it was going to last several chapters, so I gave up and started something else. I just realized it's going to jump back to the original POV very soon, but I think I'm going to pass. It wasn't hard to put it down in the first place and I really don't feel a burning desire to get back into it, so...*shrugs*Is it the YA factor? Maybe, but I think it's just a little too slow for my attention span.  One of the Reading Challenges I'm doing, is to read LGBTQ+ books.This book is really brilliant in every way. Indeed it has the Gay love story of the two teenagers but it also has a story to tell. Set in the early 50s it has illicit gay romance, possible Chinese deportation 're Communism, girls interested in S.T.E.M. subjects, and a great development of characters and plot.There's very little, if any smut in this, more suggestions. I think the love scenes are beautifully written. I loved the writing style and found it a very quick read. I look forward to reading more of this author's writing.  This book was an unexpected visitor, full of lush details and a love letter to coming of age stories and San Francisco - two of my favorite things, so of course this became my favorite.”There was probably a scientific explanation for it, but the older she got, the more she was inclined to give in to the feeling that these moments were glimpses into a world greater than this physical one. It was as if there were cycles that repeated themselves over and over, but most people never saw the repetition; they were too deeply enmeshed in their own path to see.”All these signs, she thought, pointed to this moment, and then this one, over and over again.”   This book is AMAZING literally so so good. I will never hear any complaints about this book. It is beyond perfect and I loved it so much. It's a book about San Francisco lesbians in the 1950s, absolutely perfect for me. I also feel I learned so much about Chinese culture throughout the book. This book captures your first love as a lesbian so perfectly. I felt so represented in this book and the characters of Lily and especially Kath were so relatable through their thoughts and experiences. This book made me feel so incredibly safe and made me wish I could go to the Telegraph Club myself. Such an amazing book! Please read this even if you aren't a lesbian.  I've heard this book described as ''50's lesbians in San Francisco' or other descriptions along those lines, and, honestly, it doesn't give this book the credit it is due. The characters are complex and lovable, the romance is written to be perfectly imperfect, and nothing about it tries to be something its not. This is a story of love and finding yourself written in a way that incorporates other timelines from family members and the history around these moments. Everything about this is alive and had depth, and it is everything I wanted it to be and more.  This historical fiction book is so amazing and well-detailed. I love that we get to see the romance between Lily and Kath develop throughout the novel. But most importantly, I appreciate seeing Lily's character development. Although I feel bad for her since she struggles with racism and homophobia, I'm glad she's grown a lot from the beginning to end.Thank you to Penguin Teen for providing me with an ARC on NetGalley!!   I love this author’s writing. I DNFd a previous book by her but I’m glad that I gave this one a chance. It took a little while for me to get into it though.Summary: The primary story is about Lily, a Chinese American girl living in Chinatown who is discovering that she has romantic feelings for a female classmate. Throughout the book there are additional sections/ chapters from the perspective of secondary characters in Lily’s life, like her parents and her aunt.  An amazing glimpse into 1950s San Francisco from a sappic asian perspective. Once I started could not put it down.I always get concerned about historical queer fiction because it can be overly depressing seeing how limited people were in expressing themselves. I am happy that while the difficulties existed the story focused more on showing how the community was able to thrive.  I absolutely love the way this book was set-up. I appreciated the inclusion of a timeline before each part as I was able to read a little bit about the events that shaped the story. I wish more historical fiction books incorporate this format. Despite taking quite a long time reading it, I enjoyed the story and was equally heartbroken and hopeful for the characters.  This book was everything I wish I had in high school. As a first generation immigrant I sympathised with Lily more than I realised and by the end I was crying. I could not recommend this book more to anyone, regardless of your culture or sexuality.  every lesbian should read this A phenomenal look at being a queer, teen, Chinese American woman in SF that is realistically portrayed for the time period but focused on joy and finding yourself. Simply beautiful. 
  I’ve received a digital Advance Reader’s Copy of this book through a giveaway hosted by the publisher. This has not affected my rating in any way.
 So unfortunate because I really liked the premise. Almost 400 pages and it was SO slow and such a snooze at times. The last 30-40 pages were probably the best. it was a great read, but sometimes I did not feel a connection with the main characters. The side stories were really interesting. 4.75the last part had me in the trenches crying and fighting for my life this hit too hard I usually write up and post my review immediately after reading, but this one felt like it needed to sink in and for my full feelings to develop. Once a story is over I usually am sad (if it’s good) and move on to the next great story, but with this one I’m still mourning the ending of the book. I needed to find out what happened, but at the same time I didn’t want the story to end; I read it pretty quick and couldn’t put it down. Melinda Lo did such a good job writing the book and weaving in the racism, xenophobia, homophobia, and misogyny of the time and making it all intersecting and one beautiful, complicated piece to form a narrative, rather then individual pieces and isolated incidences solely for the sake of storyline it wasn’t surprising to me when I got to the end and found out through the author’s notes this book was a direct product of her own experience and reading books of the time period. It was an intriguing and captivating look (albeit fiction) into voices that are (especially historically) extremely underrepresented: lgbt, especially poc lesbians. The only thing that didn’t quite hit the mark for me was the MC: Lilly seemed younger then 17 (almost 18) she seemed almost juvenile to me. The author was trying to portray innocence and naïveté, but unfortunately it didn’t come off that way to me. However, the rest of this story was so well done that was really a moot point in how I felt about the book as a whole. Last Night At The Telegraph Club was a snap shot/small peak of the life of a young woman in Chinatown and it both filled and crushed my heart as I read. I don’t usually reread books, or even have the desire to, but I would definitely read this book again. An amazing must read.  Este foi um livro que deixou-me surpreendido. Não foi um livro que me deu vontade de devorar em 2/3 dias (muito pelo contrário). Não foi um livro que me apresentou uma estória completamente fora da caixa. No entanto, termino-o e a sensação que deixa é a de uma enorme satisfação por ter lido algo tão inesperadamente 'fresco'. Conhecemos Lily que é a típica adolescente que está a atravessar um processo de entender aquilo que é e aquilo que sente, descobre o amor e procura no mundo que a rodeia 'espelhos' onde se sinta representada. Até aqui nada de novo. No entanto nesta obra a autora transporta-nos para os EUA dos anos 50, oferecendo toda uma nova e irreverente abordagem aquilo que podia ser um típico drama jovem adulto. A guerra, as diferenças culturais, a perseguição aos homossexuais, complementa esta história de uma forma magistral, provocando no leitor jovem do século XXI uma introspecção sobre as dificuldades e sacrifícios que muitos sofreram para que hoje nenhuma Lily precise de todo um plano elaborado para dar um simples beijo ou abraço a quem ama. É preciso não esquecer e continuar a lutar pela liberdade, todos os dias. Este é um livro jovem adulto completamente diferente dos demais que temos visto por aí, e merece ser destacado por isso. De leitura recomendada a todos.  I've been meaning to read *Last Night at the Telegraph Club* for so long, and I'm glad I finally did! This story and these characters were everything I've been looking for. The characters and the setting (mid-1950s San Francisco) were so vivid and interacted with this story and pushed it forward so well, and I think Malinda Lo was a genius for that. Her author's note was super informative about what inspired her to create Lily Hu and the world she lives in as well.The only reason this isn't a five-star read was because I thought that, while the writing isn't bad, it could have been better and could've made several scenes flow better. Sometimes it just felt very cold compared to what was happening on the page, and it summed things up for the reader when we could've figured it out ourselves.Interestingly, the pacing of the entire book was really good, but some scenes focused on the wrong moments for a bit too long while other moments that should have been expanded on only lasted a sentence. Some details weren't even super necessary and didn't need to be written at all, or should've at least been interwoven with the scene more skillfully.Either way, I enjoyed this book a lot and recommend it to everyone who loves queer fiction and people thriving in situations that try to push them down.The cover is also gorgeous and the title is perfect!  What a powerful story. I felt like I wanted to continue watching Lily move through life even after the epilogue. I wanted to know exactly what her happy ending looked like.We follow Lily, a senior in high school, in the 1950's who is slowly realizing she's a lesbian and what that would mean if her Chinese American family were to find out. As she gets closer to Kath and starts secretly frequenting a homosexual bar, she continues to gain confidence in who she is.Malindo Lo made the decision to stick with terms that were used from the time period, and also did her research on making sure the various lettering for the different Chinese languages were true to the time period. As a linguist nerd, I loved reading her informative background on this at the back of the book. The relationship between Kath and Lily was so wholesome, and I absolutely loved the slow build of their romance. It was so freaking cute. The one thing I felt was slightly lacking is I would have loved to see more of how Aunt Judy treated her as time goes on (if you get what I mean). I also was confused by the Tommy scene (again, I hope you know which one I'm talking about. The significant one) I would've liked more on that following the moment.4.5 stars, rounded up to 5 stars.  i was going to give this 4 stars because i was bored but the latter part of the book gutted my soul out. anyways i know this was in the 1950s and i could never really say that i went through the same thing but something similarish happened a few months ago and this book managed to portray it in ways i couldn’t imagine it myself doing. also being half asian and growing up in the middle east, i appreciate how you can clearly see how the racism affected her life, it didn’t revolve around it, but it did something to her. very touching book for me the ending was devastating because it’s exactly where i am right now minus an amazing s/o (very unfair) but i was still holding hopes that it would turn out differently for her and her parents yk so that i’d have a sliver of hope for my own relationship with them   It's very hard not to fall in love with the story Malinda Lo weaves for us. Although I found the writing to be too YA at times (too repetitive, an overabundance of metaphors and similes), Lo captures the time period she writes about so perfectly and fully immerses us in it. Lily's conflict as both a Chinese American and a lesbian navigating a time and place that were hostile to both, her inability to truly belong in either community, as well as her romance with Kath, all unfold poignantly. I particularly loved how we see both Lily and Kath coming into their identity as lesbians, starting to decide how they want to present themselves (Kath being butch, Lily being femme) and having others recognize that in them—it was done very subtly and naturally. A very enjoyable and affecting read!  4.25🌟 this was such a well-rounded, honest coming-of-age story, following Lily, as she navigates growing up in 1950s San Francisco. it really felt like we were on the journey of self-discovery with her, as she questions her sexuality and how she fits into the world as a Chinese American girl in a society that isn't necessarily safe for her and her family. kath and lily's love story is beautiful and heartbreaking and felt realistic to the limitations of the time period.   There's something really special about reading historical fiction with lgbt characters, because of how often we are written out of every narrative and erased from time. Last Night at the Telegraph Club was very thoughtfully researched and situated in space and time, and as a Bay Area native, it was especially lovely to see Lily live and love in the same streets and communities I've grown up in and around.   It is 1954, and Lily is a high school student in San Francisco's Chinatown. When she finds an ad for a show starring a woman dressed as a man, she tears it out, and accidentally shares it with another girl. They decide to go to the Telegraph Club together to see the show, equipped with fake IDs declaring them to be over 18. Things get very complicated, and without revealing too much, the climate in 1954 is not welcoming to the women who patronize the Telegraph Club. I don't usually read young adult books, but this one worked as both historical fiction, and to spotlight the challenges faced by LGBT teens in an intolerant society.  This definitely deserves all the accolades it has received, including the National Book Award for YA fiction. The quality and sophistication of the writing, research, and narrative structure are truly exceptional, and it’s also just an excellent story, meaningful and moving at the same time. An enjoyable and revelatory reading and learning experience!  I really enjoyed this. I don't read many books about the 20th century, or America, but I did pick this up on a whim as it had so many good reviews. And I'm really glad I did.Lily's life was interesting, and complex, and reading it you knew there would be a moment for her where everything would go wrong and it did. But it was surprisingly near the end of the book, so first there was 300 pages of self discovery and reflection and youthful innocence and joy. Which was nice.  gah what a good book!!! a 1950s gay girls YA romance set in San Francisco???? everything.the first half of this book was pretty slow but it’s ok because i fell in love with the second half. i also really liked the authors note at the end where Lo went into further depth about the treatment of queer Asian American women in the 1950s.i am so so happy that there are an increasing number of books out there about gay women for girls and women to read. i wish i had had these stories popularized and available to me when i was in middle/high school. i wish i could know how i would have felt reading them. all i can say now is that these stories fill me with an indescribable warmth and recognition, and i am so grateful for them. cant wait to read more!!  A stunning and complete surprise. Extremely well researched and written this book gave me butterflies and broke my heart all at once. I finished with a nostalgia for the queer pioneers who paved the way for us to live freely and also for my younger self and experiences. A new favourite.  4.5 stars This is a *fantastic* read, deserving of the many awards it has received. It's got it all--midcentury America setting and details, romance, history, and coming of age and all that comes with it. Can't believe I'm so late to read it. I'll know better when Lo's companion book, A Scatter of Light, comes out this fall.  cannot recommend this book more highly Fajne, chciałabym to przeczytać w wieku 17-18 lat. comparing my coming out to lily's even though hers would obviously be much worse bc its the 1950s going i'm sorry i'm so sorry this beautiful thing was taken from youmy soft gay heart hurts 4.5 because it was a bit slow in parts but everything else was amazing  i read this for the first time over two years ago and my rating/review is somehow gone?this is my favorite book of all time i’ll write a real review next time i read it, cool? One of the best books I have read. period. 4.75/5napisana ze wspaniale zachowanym klimatem, wypełniona queerowością z każdej strony w naturalny i ludzki sposób. absolutny must read Not only is this a great YA novel, it's a great lesbian romance, it's a great history of the Chinese American experience, it's a great history of the lesbian scene in 1950s San Francisco, it's a great history of Chinese immigrant impact on the Space Race. It's just really damn good. so good :") and hits way too close to home this book gave me so much feels. the historical context, the language, the characters. wow. i couldn’t get enough of it. only wished i could’ve read it faster but school got in the way of that.  Malinda Lo is out here single-handedly restoring my interest and faith in YA *4.5 Look guys I have Goodreads now so certain people can stop giving me threatening looks. Overall good book, sweet and well-written.Thank you certain people for giving me this book as well as threatening looks. This historical fiction book is filled with an under-examined chapter of U.S. history in 1950s San Francisco from the day-to-day lives in Chinatown to women in the sciences. The book is packed with themes: power of first love, family dynamics, cultural expectations. Lily has been taught to live by certain expectations, and she’s not afraid to face consequences for breaking them to live life her way. The most powerful aspects of the book are the characters Malinda Lo brings to life at the Telegraph Club. Among the lights, the smoke, the music, the drinks, it is the conversation and the characters in the nightclub that send this book over the top.   (4.5 ⭐) A compelling, candid, quietly beautiful piece of historical fiction and queer coming-of-age story. We follow Lily, a Chinese American teenager living in 1954 San Francisco. Her assumptions about life &amp; love slowly start to unravel as she questions her identity and stumbles into the underground lesbian nightlife community. Lily is unexpectedly crushing on her classmate Kath, but between communism paranoia and the crushing expectations of being a “good Chinese girl”, her world isn’t safe. How can she fall into her first love without losing her family and safety? The writing is thoughtful and clearly well-researched. While we’re mainly focused on the ‘50s, we get a few time skips and learn more about the generations of Lily’s family along the way. The story feels incredibly grounded in historical reality. While I loved watching Lily’s journey identifying as a lesbian, I wished we got a bit beyond the surface level for Kath. She was just kind of there to blandly complement Lily and to bring her into the nightclub scene. I think there could have been a more compelling push-and-pull between them. Side character Shirley had a lot more going on - and though she was far less likable, she was more interesting. There are so many opportunities for readers of all ages to see themselves on the page. Some strengths include: various queer &amp; lesbian identities, Lily’s struggles with racism as a Chinese American, Lily’s voracious pursuit of sapphic representation, and Lily’s desire to pursue STEM and Kath’s desire to be a pilot. It is really difficult and tense, specifically in the last 30% or so of the book. There’s a lot of slowness at the start, and then an explosion of danger &amp; action all at once without quite enough time for resolution.  Lily is so earnest and curious - I really enjoyed witnessing her arc, and only wished the story had covered a few more years. I would love to see how she continues to tackle her anxiety and how she lives as an adult (outside of the boundaries of her immediate family). Lily is incredibly naive from start to end, and I wanted to see her knowledge expand.  Overall, I loved the focus on first love and discovering identity and connecting with roots &amp; culture while still embracing the new &amp; hopeful.

 for book recommendations!(I received a free copy of this book; this is my honest review.)  What a fascinating story Last Night at the Telegraph Club by Malinda Lo. It's not my normal type of novel but I enjoyed it very much. Let's see. It's set in San Francisco's Chinatown in the mid-1950's and features 17 year old Lily Hu, a young girl finishing high school and dreaming of her future. It's an interesting troubling time. The McCarthy era is taking place, the Feds are searching for Communists and the Chinese community is not immune to this pressure. Lily is trying to just grow up and decide she wants to do in the future. She loves Sci-Fi and dreams of working in the Jet Propulsion Labs with her aunt Judy. But Lily is also discovering something else; that she is homosexual and is falling for fellow high school student, Kath. Her friendship with Kath is causing friction with her Chinese - American friends, especially best friend Shirley. Lily finds an advertisement for Telegraph Club and its headliner, male impersonator Tommy Andrews and she feels a strong desire to go to the club which is just down the road. Her first furtive visit to the club with Kath will change the course of Lily's relatively sheltered life.Malinda Lo has presented a rich, fascinating story where she follows Lily's life and also tries to tie her actions into the events taking place in San Francisco and the US during that time period. She portrays the history of Lily's family, how they arrived in the US, the pressures they are under as a result of the Communist witch hunt; her father has his citizenship papers taken away for refusing to implicate other Chinese in the Communist scare. The interplay between Lily's Chinese community and the surrounding San Francisco community is well-described. And the hidden, furtive life of the homosexuals in San Francisco is also brought into focus. It's an excellent story, emotional, sensitive and powerful, peopled with interesting characters and it leaves with a hopeful ending. Well worth trying. (4.0 stars)  so lovely. I felt so immersed in 1950s San Francisco Chinatown, clearly so thoughtfully researched. also I read this on BART so just a 10/10 reading experience. I loved the flashback sequences with Lily’s family &amp; the food descriptions were sooo good. one of my favorite lesbian YAs for sure.   It’s a very nice story. I liked the 1950s era atmosphere created here, and how the 1950s and the historical events shaped the characters, cultural and emotional perspectives. The main character, Lily is brilliantly reflects the thoughts and behaviour of the girls growing up in this era, as well as her parents, and other girls. All so accurate and amazingly represented here. Other good thing I really liked is that how the author set the romance line between the girls, Lily and Kath; it was so satisfying. I still would prefer if the ending will be stronger, not just in the closing epilogue.Overall, a good piece of YA historical fiction.  a quietly heartfelt coming of age story brimming with love and ambition. it made me smile but it definitely brought on some tears, too i've been searching for this book for so long and the fact that i came across it randomly in walmart means it's a sign for me to read it immediately I think I liked the idea behind this book, but not the execution. Chinese-American girl, dealing with her sexuality in the 1950s hits all the high notes for me, but I had trouble getting into the story, and even once I did, it was slow going. There are "flashback," chapters that are written from the pov of Lily's mother, father, and aunt, and outside of providing a certain amount of context for the time period and some vagaries about the difficulties that Chinese immigrants were facing at the time, they really didn't add anything to the story. It made me feel like the author wasn't sure about what to focus on- sexuality or nationality- and while those things can and do coexist with equal importance, the way it was presented had the effect of not making either one feel particularly significant to me. I think that Lily is a relatable character, and I liked her for the most part, which is why I think I kept reading. She doesn't have many friends, and she's just starting to discover herself while dealing with racism and the fear of her father being potentially deported. But because she's so interior, we don't get a lot of information about anyone else in the story. I had trouble envisioning some of the other characters, just because they felt kind of flat to me. Even her relationship with Kath (which takes half the book to develop, and still somehow manages to come across as kind of shallow), felt extremely under-developed. Outside of a few quick jaunts to the Telegraph Club, and some after-school strolls, I didn't get the feeling that they spent a lot of time together. And while I could buy their attraction, I couldn't buy their more enduring feelings. Nothing much happens over the course of a nearly 400 page book, and that's a bit unforgivable just because I'm such a slow reader. We never get to see the really exciting bits because it seems like they're usually happening to a character that isn't Lily. I wanted to like this, but I really felt very little for the characters or the story. I think it was important to the author, but perhaps that was why it fell flat to me. I can usually relate to minority stories, given that I am a minority, even if our cultures aren't the same, but I just didn't feel very connected to this one.   What struck me the most about Last Night at the Telegraph Club was how separate Lily Hu is from the world around her. She is a watcher. She pays attention to the details of what happens around her as she tries to understand who she is in relation to the world. Only when she is with Kath do the details become fuzzy and she fully engages.Towards the end of the book, I thought a lot about a conversation I had with my mother when one of my best friends came out. I was mad at my friend’s mother for being unhappy about her daughter’s orientation, and my mom was explaining that her mother was worried about how difficult her life was going to be as a lesbian. I was frustrated by that without knowing how to explain why that felt wrong. What I understand now is that there is nothing inherently difficult about being a lesbian, or gay. It’s other people who choose to make life difficult. My friend is fine, happily married to her partner of almost 30 years (they met in high school) with a successful career, and of those of us who grew up together, probably the happiest.Lily’s quiet rebellions and subtle insistence on being herself were a joy to read. She hides pieces of herself from people who won’t appreciate them, but doesn’t let go. She took down the picture of the imagined moon colony, but she never lets go of her interest in math, or in space. When invited to take the easy way out, she hangs on to her hard won truths about herself.A generous read of Lily’s parents is that they don’t want life to be harder for her, and they can’t imagine that Lily could have a fulfilling life as anything other than a “good Chinese girl.” The interstitials show us that they have not had the lives they planned. And we know that their lives are harder because they are Chinese American. I was left with a hope for Lily that as hard as life might be for her, existing as she does in the intersection of marginalizations, it will also be fulfilling because she has not let go of her whole self.  "her mother's face swam into focus, her brown eyes full of the sharp worry of love, and Lily thought: "you will never look at me like this again."Last Night at the Telegraph Club despite being fiction, to me felt a lot like a (at times) non-fiction study of a generation of Chinese American family living in the 1950s in San Francisco. As we follow Lily on her journey of self-discovery, we get immersed in the reality of those times. I'm not Chinese American myself, or either of those really nor am I a child of immigrants, so I can't really tell how accurate this portrayal was. However, I do feel like Malinda Lo knew what she was writing about (in regards to historical context), clearly she did her research judging by the notes at the end of the book, and I did feel completely enveloped by the reality and the setting she presented (for better or worse). The way the author incorporated the political situation and model minority myth into the story, at least to my knowledge, was really well-done.As for the story itself, I did really enjoy it but I will say it was very slow-paced, which isn't a bad thing but I do personally wish there was a little more of a pay-off in regards of the romantic storyline. For some reason I thought this is primarly a romance, which it kind of is but also... not really. We don't really get a whole lot of the romance content itself. What we did get though, I loved. I admit I found this book very stressful to read. As a queer person living with homophobic family myself, I got A LOT of second-hand anxiety from this. It felt so real and hit so close to home, anyone with similar situation or experiences should keep that in mind when picking up this work.  Ultimately though, I really enjoyed this book and got invested. It was so bittersweet and just... UGH sad, just so sad but also Kath, Lily and Lana deserve the world. Well-deserved, solid four stars.  Every time I read a book about queer women, something in my soul heals a little more. It’s remarkable how Malinda Lo’s characters really make you feel seen, all the wonderful and horrible parts of being queer discussed so honestly.Last Night at the Telegraph Club is a time machine that takes you to San Francisco's Chinatown in the 1950s. There’s no other way to describe it. From the language, to the historical backdrop, to the culture, to the description of the city as the main character, Lily, walks through it. It’s fully immersive. Watching Lily slowly learn about herself made me feel like a cheerleader, screaming my support from the sidelines as she tried to understand what it means to be queer without any of the vocabulary we have today. The layers of Lily’s struggle with identity pile up. She’s a girl who wants to study math, her other friends wondering why she won’t just date a nice boy and settle down. She’s Chinese-American during McCarthyism. She’s queer as gay clubs are being raided. It’s unlike any YA novel I’ve ever read.And of course, she meets a girl. The other math loving girl at her school who tells Lily she’s been to the Telegraph Club, a gay club for women, and will take her if she wants to go. The Telegraph Club is dazzling, welcoming anyone who walks through its doors. Tommy Andrews, male impersonator, captures all of her audience members effortlessly, even the readers. The club, aka this book, is a haven of confusion and longing and joy and community. I couldn’t put it down until I finished and as soon as I did my first thought was when the final version will be out so I can pick it up again.  3 stars.My favorite part about Last Night at the Telegraph Club was the setting - I miss San Francisco (and the Bay Area) so much, and while reading this book, I was transported into 1950s San Francisco and Chinatown - I felt like I was actually there. I loved how Malinda Lo really brought San Francisco to life in this book. The vivid writing allowed me to almost fully immerse into the setting and experience the story of Lily Hu and her navigating her queer, lesbian identity in a society and culture that doesn't accept her for who she is. As a Chinese American, I also really appreciated all of the Chinese culture, language, and traditions that were infused in this book!I'm sad that I can't rate this book higher, but I felt that some of the storylines were not fully developed and resolved (like some things happened and then were never brought up again), and I expected more from the ending. I also wish that the f/f romance was better developed and that we got more scenes between Lily and Kath so I could be more emotionally invested in them. Overall, I did enjoy the setting and atmosphere of this book, and I learned a lot about the historical context, McCarthyism, and the anti-Communist sentiment in the U.S. in this time period. I still would recommend this book because we need more queer historical fiction in our lives (especially those surrounding people of color)!Trigger warnings: homophobia (&amp; slurs), racism (&amp; slurs), sexism &amp; misogyny, mention of deportation, mention of miscarriage  (7/10)I'll admit that I have some conflicted feelings towards Last Night at the Telegraph Club. The pacing in the first 60-70% of the book was slower than I expected, enough so that I didn't always feel compelled to pick it back up and see what happens next. Some of the chapters felt repetitive to me, but I do love a good slow burn, so I can't be too mad about it.One of the things I appreciated the most about this book was that Malinda Lo clearly put a lot of research into what life in 1950s San Francisco would have actually been like. Her descriptions of SF are meticulously detailed, which allows Lily's world to spring to life and feel entirely real. The personalities of some of the supporting characters such as Lana and Claire all kind of blended together for me, but I really liked that basically none of them were entirely likable. I could sympathize with Lily's parents, her aunt and uncle, and her friend Shirely while also being extremely annoyed with them. It's characters like that that feel the most human to me. And I really liked how this story ended—it was somewhat ambiguous while also wrapping things up just enough to leave you feeling satisfied with the journey you just went on. Overall, this book maybe fell just a little bit short of the high expectations I had for it, but I think it's fair to write a lot that off as me not necessarily being within the target audience for this book. If you enjoy historical fiction and/or romance, I'd recommend giving this book a try.  Just beautiful! Hopeful while being realistic for the 50s Lo does an amazing job with the setting - glamorous and secretive clubs! - and Lily is a great character. I remember being at the YALSA ya lit symposium in 2014 or 2015 and listening to a panel about LGBTQ teen books. Some ignorant librarian asked whether a book that had a character with multiple identities was “too much for teens.” People literally gasped. Without missing a beat, Malinda Lo was like, “Well no, I exist and I’m not too much.” I’ll always remember it because the applause was thunderous. Iconic.   I loved this book. The beginning was really slow and it dragged a lot but when it finally picked up I couldn't put it down. The chapters are really short which makes you wanna read more and more.I loved the romance and Lily's realization that she's lesbian (as a lesbian myself) it really spoke to me. I related to a lot of her struggles even though I, luckily, am not living in San Francisco in the 1950s.It's a historical fiction and I learned a lot about the Japanese-War with China, the communists and Chinese-Americans.I think the book lacked a lot of characterization though and it was a little boring at times. Otherwise the romance, plot and representation was great."Boys and girls, men and women, smiling at each other or talking animatedly, hands touching, unafraid to be seen together. She felt a growling jealousy in the pit of her stomach at the unfairness of it.""She was even more aware of the undulating space between them, like an invisible barrier that could not be crossed - not in public.""The more her mother insisted it was a mistake, the more certainLily was that it wasn't. Perhaps that was the most perverse part of this: the inside-outness of everything, as if denial would make it go away, when it only made the pain in her chest tighten, when it only made her emotions clearer."  I wish I had liked this more. There were parts of this story that captivated me, but other parts just seemed unnecessary and very lengthy in description/detail. I liked Lily as a character and I could definitely see her change throughout the book, as she figured out more about herself. But I would've liked to see even more growth, for there to have been some drastic revelation at the end for her character (either before or after the jump in time). Of course this is just me wanting more from the story. I liked Lily's friendship budding into a relationship with Kath as well. I liked how Kath led her to exploring the parts of herself she was afraid to admit existed. It was a cute and simple love story that was hindered by historical differences in how the LGBTQ+ community was seen. It's crazy to read this, knowing it is historically accurate, and seeing how different it is today. I'm glad the world is more open now, even if it still isn't as accepting as it should be. This overall was a good book. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't outstanding. There was something more that I needed from it, whether it be more character growth from Lily or something else, I'm unsure but I would still recommend it.   This was a very character driven book, so if your looking for a fast paced plot this isn’t for you. But if you enjoy following well written characters through their lives you should pick this book up. This book follows lily as she starts to discover who she is and how she can be true to herself in a time that doesn’t except anyone that doesn’t fit in to the box of “normal”. I enjoyed the history in this book. There where pages with timelines which was great. The time this book was set in was a very hard time for Chinese Americans and through lily I got to understand how scary and hard it would be feeling like you can’t be you with out putting yourself and the ones you love in danger of deportation. I do wish this book had a different ending but that being said it still was a satisfying ending. Well worth a read if you like books that deep dive into a characters life and hard hitting topics in a time that wasn’t willing to understand peoples differences.   I would describe this book as “pretty good.” The central story—of two 17 year old girls discovering their gayness and their community—was engaging. Their story of young love was sweet and I really, really loved the warmth and lived-in feeling of the women at the Telegraph Club and the club itself as a lesbian refuge of sorts. And I appreciated the poignancy of Lily being an outsider among outsiders, as a Chinese American lesbian. But unfortunately the book had some unnecessary plots that didn’t really go anywhere. Several were started and then just dropped. And while I appreciate the desire to give more information about the adult characters, the flashback scenes were just not successful for me.So pretty good, I’m not mad I read it, but I’ll be swapping or selling my copy.   folks that was some of the best time spent on book like ever I really enjoyed this! This is a great historical fiction novel that highlights some extremely important topics, and I think Malinda Lo did an excellent job writing this book. I love her author's note detailing the research she did and this story feels very personal, which I think just adds to how good this novel is. I will admit, I did not love the ending (I wanted some more explanations to be quite honest) and I felt like some of the plot points and characters weren't fleshed out quite enough, but overall this was a very enjoyable book and one I will definitely return to. 4 stars!  My favorite WLW novel to this day. 100% recommend. The only reason why it's 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wanted MORE of Lily and Kath; I don't want to say their relationship is underdeveloped but I wish they had more page time.  i spent the entire beginning of this book trying to figure out where i'd read the same concept before, and it turns out that i was thinking of Malinda Lo's gorgeous short story in All Out!! literally didn't realize until the author's note lmao. this book was so beautiful and heartwarming and relatable and i loved it so, so much. the audiobook was gorgeous and i already can't wait to pick up a physical copy and reread it!  (4.25) i want what they have💔. I felt a range of emotions while reading this book, both good and bad. I was underwhelmed with the ending, which is why I gave it a slightly lower rating than I would have at first. Even though I would have liked to know more about the ending, I still adored this book.  edit: i haven’t stopped thinking about this book for over a year so i think the rating change is deserved thank u malinda lo MY HEART WKFJHDS I talk about my thoughts on this book in this BookTube video. It would have been better if the love interest had any personality at all. Or maybe I am just sadly growing out of YA Absolutely fascinating. An era and culture I’ve rarely explored in my readings, but I’m glad I did. There were some authorial decisions that I didn’t love, but overall, this was a good read.  the only book ever 3.5  thank god for epilogues omgrtc i’m stunned  3.5/5 چطوری از این کتاب حرف بزنم؟ از کجا شروع کنم اصلا؟ چطوری تمومش کنم؟تا حالا شده یه کتابی بخونید که انگار داستانش کل زندگی توی قلبتون بوده و با خوندن اون کتاب، دوباره پیداش کردید؟ یه کتابی که خیلی خیلی دوست دارید ولی هرچقدرم نگاه میکنید چیز فوق‌العاده‌ای توش نمیبینید؟ این کتاب برای من اینجوری بود. حس می‌کردم تمام عمرم رو توی این دنیا زندگی کردم و خوندنش برام یه حس نوستالژی داشت با اینکه اولین بار بود میرفتم سمتش. نمیتونم بگم این کتاب بی نظیره، نمی‌تونم بگم شاهکار هنریه، نمیتونم بگ�� قطعا عاشقش میشید ولی میتونم بگم من یه ارتباط خیلی عجیب و عمیق باهاش برقرار کردم. میتونم بگم "برای من" این کتاب بی نظیره، شاهکار هنریه و من عاشقشم!خود کتاب، از دیدگاه بی طرف خیلی خوبه. قلمش خیلی خیلی قشنگه و یه خصوصیتی داره که دقیقا نمیتونم توصیف کنم. شیرینه، خوشمزه‌ست، آدم دلش میخواد کلمه به کلمه‌ی توصیفاتش رو ببلعه. یه نمونه‌ی کوچیکش:"The voice that emerged was pitched low and husky, like a jazz singer with smoke on her breath. A faint gasp went through the audience as if people were surprised, but Lily knew it wasn’t surprise. It was acknowledgment of how immaculate the male impersonation was, how shockingly well staged. The contrast between Tommy’s voice (especially when it rose smoothly to the higher notes) and silhouette (legs spread and shoulders cocked) was deliciously scandalous."تک‌تک لحظات این کتاب جلوی چشممه. قلمش محشر بود. شخصیت پردازیا؟ به شدت عالی بودن! من عاشق لی‌لی و کث و تامی و بقیه‌ی آدمای تلگراف کلاب شدم. مخصوصا تامی...من هیچوقت "فن" کسی یا گروهی نبودم. اصلا توی خودم اینو نمیبینم که بتونم شیفته‌ی یه نفر باشم یا به کارش خیلی علاقه مند باشم ولی تامی اندروز؟ تامی اگه وجود داشت من مطمئنم ستایشش میکردم اصلا😂تامی یکی از شاهکارای این کتاب بود. خودش، رفتارش، همه‌ی حرکتاش، براب من اینقدر جذاب و مثل آهنربا بود که وقتی توی صحنه‌های کتاب بود به خاطر هیجان نمیتونستم درست کلماتو بخونم. یه صحنه‌ای بود (که نمیخوام اسپویل کنم فقط کلیدواژه میدم خونه‌شون) که تامی خیلی پررنگ بود توش. از لحظه‌ای که تامی گفت "Hello there" تا لحظه‌ای که صحنه تموم شد من دستم جلوی دهنم بود و نفس نمیکشیدم. یه چیزی درباره‌ی تامی اندروز بود، یه چیزی که حتی نمیدونم چی بود ولی مثل یه آهنربا بود. طبیعتا نمیتونم بگم برای همه همینه ولی برای من، تامی قشنگ نمونه‌ی دقیق آدمیه که برای من خیلی خیلی جذابه...و گفتم هیجان...ماه‌ها بود، ماه‌ها، که من برای یه کتاب اینقدر هیجان زده نشده بودم. توی نقطه‌های زیادی فقط میخواستم جیغ بکشم و به جاش صفحه‌ی چت دوستمو باز میکردم و ویسایی میفرستادم که نصفش نامفهوم بود. این حس ذوق رو ماه‌ها بود حس نکرده بودم. رابطه‌ی عاشقانه‌ای این کتاب...وای! واقعا نمیدونم چی بگم. تا یه جایی نزدیک وسط کتاب، هیچ چیز شفافی بین لی‌لی و کث نبود. وقتی میگم شفاف یعنی من خواننده میتونستم دقیقا لمس کنم که یه چیز الکتریک شدید بینشونه ولی اون دوتا، نه به وضوح درباره‌ی چیزی حرف میزدن نه کاری میکردن. همین باعث میشد چیزای کوچیک، چیزای خیلی خیلی کوچیک بینشون هم لذت بخش باشه و اون توصیفات کوچیک هم قلبمو به تپش مینداخت...Lily reached out and impulsively took Kath’s hand in hers. Kath started, but then she let Lily hold her hand.Lily knew immediately that this was different. It wasn’t like grabbing Kath’s hand to pull her into the supply room. Instinctively, Lily ran her thumb across Kath’s palm, feeling the swell of Kath’s flesh and the delicate thread of the vein in her wrist, the fluttering of Kath’s pulse beneath her fingertip. She heard Kath catch her breath.همین میل شدید به اینکه یه اتفاقی بینشون بیوفته و نیوفتادنش، باعث شد وقتی بالاخره یه چیزی شد...باید بگم چپتر ۳۲ انفجار بود. تعداد خطایی که هایلایت نکردم از خطایی که هایلات کردم کمتره:)حدود ۷۰ صفحه‌ی آخر این کتاب قلبمو شکست. چون که...دقیقا شرایط الان ایرانه. اگه لی‌لی یه دختری بود که همین الان ۱۷ ساله بود و توی ایران زندگی میکرد، همون شرایطی رو داشت که توی این کتاب داشت. وقتی خانواده‌ش فهمیدن واقعیت چیه...رفتارشون رفتاری بود که اگه خانواده‌ی الان چنین چیزی رو بفهمه داره و این خیلی درد داشت. شرایط کث و لی‌لی، اینکه مجبور بودن خود واقعیشونو مخفی کنن، رابطشونو مخفی کنن و برای نزدیک بودن به هم همیشه یه جا قایم شن و بعد تنها جایی که توش آزاد بودن، The Telegraph club، هم از بین رفت و خانواده‌ی لی‌لی اون رفتار و داشتن...همین امروز ایران بود!با این تفاوت که زمان این کتاب سال 1954 بود! توی زمان ابن کتاب آدم‌ها هنوز نتونسته بودن پا روی ماه بذارن. حالا انسان‌ها روی ماه قدم زدن و سال‌ها گذشته و ایران تازه توی اون نقطه‌ست! بچه‌های ایران تازه توی اون نقطه‌ان!و شاید برای همین این کتاب اینقدر برای من عزیز بود. چون به طرز دردناکی امروز کشور ما رو برای آدمایی شبیه لی‌لی، کث، تامی و لانا توصیف کرده بود!“You’re not listening to me!” Lily cried. “I’m like them.”“There are no homosexuals in this family,” she said, the words thick with disgust.“You are young,” her mother said harshly. “You aren’t even eighteen years old yet. Sometimes girls have these ideas when they’re younger—before they meet their husbands. Girls love their friends and mistake that for the love they’ll have for their husbands...This is just a mistake.”“It’s not a mistake,” Lily said miserably.Her mother strode across the kitchen and slapped her.پس آره...یه دلیل اینکه این کتابو خیلی دوست داشتم این بود که لی‌لی رو خیلی درک میکردم و اینکه یه سری چیزا رو تجربه کرد که برای خیلی خیلی آشنا بود.و امیدوارم که بخونیدش چون واقعا ارزشش رو داره.پ.ن: دوباره لازمه بگم تامی خیلی جذاب بود😂  *slight spoilers*This books starts pretty slowly, with a lot of exposition to the Asian American community of SF in the 50s, and getting to know the characters and where they come from. Lo takes us back in time with some events in Lily's parents and her aunt's pasts, all the while following Lily and her discovery of herself. It was really interesting, but halfway through the book I did start to wonder if that was the book (which is totally cool, just not what I expected) of if there was more. Spoilers alert: there was more, and it made that first half so important, and I was very happy to have read those 200 pages of backstory. All that exposition is necessary to understand the rest of the book, at least for me (a white lesbian). Everything felt so real, raw and true to history, almost painfully so. It really made me look back at how much queer people have suffered and had to fight to be recognized as "normal". It also added that dimension that I did not live: the clash between culture, especially Asian culture, and homosexuality. This book made me learn so much, and opened my eyes in many many ways.I really enjoyed how Malinda Lo developed her characters: I find that in YA books, they are rarely as well presented and as tridimentionals as the ones presented here. Lily's growth is hearthwrenching and heartfelt; I really felt for her, and got a huge wave of gratitude for the women like her who paved the way for women like me today. Her relationship with her childhood best friend and her family was one that I understood deeply even with a different experience of them, and I kept turning the page wondering how Lily would deal with that. Her and Kath's discovery of each other, and their support of each other's dreams were really refreshing: Lo really put forward a first relationship and all the shyness and awkwardness that comes with it, but also how healthy it can be, how it doesn't need to be filled with angst, anger and misunderstandings.People who know me know that I very very rarely cry actual tears, and this book did trigger water drops forming in my eye sockets. The pain was so raw and intense, and brought me so much gratitude and knowledge. This book really is an important piece of queer literature, and really is not only for teens: I think that ever sapphic person should read this, as it brings forward a part of our history that is not often shown, but that is so important.A big 5 stars from me, this book destroyed me (in a very sad but good way).  honestly needed some time to collect my thoughts about this book by that I mean a few hours of just staring at nothingness but I’m finally ready. 5 stars This book follows seventeen-year-old Lili hu who one day finds an ad in the paper for a male impersonator club called the telegraph club. And what happens after she decides to go with her friend Kathleen Miller.Trigger warnings: parental abuse, sexism, misogyny, racism, racial slurs, deportation, death of a loved one, homophobia, internalized homophobia, miscarriageCharacters I loved the main character in this book. Lili was just an extremely relatable person and I just felt like I could relate to her experience as a POC, a firstborn, and a queer woman. LO did an amazing job at balancing all of the different aspects of her character to not let one thing undervalue another. Kath was an amazing love interest I wish would have gotten to know more about her but I completely understand why we didn’t like a white queer woman she didn’t have to face nearly as many hardships as Lili and being that the book many focused on the Asian American experience. I loved that we got some chapters about Lili’s family, especially aunt Judy. I wished we would have gotten to see more of aunt Judy and Lily's relationship. PlotThe thing that drew me the most to this book was the whole idea of the club for male impersonators. It’s always great to learn more about queer history but I was sort of worried that I would get bored but boy was I wrong. Not only did we get to learn about queer history but also Asian American history and how does two worlds collided through our main character . this book was extremely well researched and the way that the history was weaving into the story felt so natural and effortless, it was truly breathtaking. RomanceI personally didn’t think the romance was as big of a plot point as it was made out to be but that doesn’t mean I didn’t really enjoy it. I just wished we would have gotten to see more of the relationship development between Lili and Kath. This book is the most breathtakingly beautiful book I have ever read, everything about it from the history to the extremely reliable main character felt so real and raw. it felt like a really good history lesson and a warm gay hug at the same time.PS: I still cried for a full 30 minutes afterward  I will never stop talking about it and it is now a new comfort book.  Ladies... NEVER have a homoerotic friendship with your girl best friend! It worked out for Lily and Kath but they're an anomaly!Real talk though, this book was so good... Ms. Malinda Lo, you got the sapphic yearning, sapphic teenage love, sapphic everything down so good... She took everything happening in my head when I was in Lily's shoes and put it on paper. The yearning is real.The writing was really simplistic and it felt a bit flat at first, but this is definitely a story that builds up to its ending. I wasn't the biggest fan of the flashbacks to the parents -- I felt it was unnecessary -- but everything else? Chef's kiss. So good. When I first started this, I was complaining that the writing was simplistic and juvenile, but then I realized that it was supposed to be; they're 16. I remember being 16, it was just like that. Simplistic, juvenile, and a whole lot of fuck-ass feelings all at once.This book made me feel everything from being hit by a brick to intense rage to as if there was a waterfall inside my chest.  Ms. Hu, when I catch you... I also really liked how it was period accurate. I haven't read too many books from the 1950s -- not even mentioning LGBTQ+ or Chinese American books from that period -- but this felt... authentic, in a way? My perception of that period was exactly how this book was. It didn't feel wrong at all, like how some authors try too hard to make it accurate that it just doesn't hit. In the author's note (which was 4 pages long), all of Lo's research was laid bare, and, honestly, I'm impressed!My only complaint (I wouldn't even say complaint, really) was the lack of atmosphere; the only place in the USA that I really want to go to is San Francisco, so it disappointed me greatly that there wasn't much description in that part. I was able to visualize Chinatown perfectly (even though my imagination was at WORK!), but I would've loved to see more of the city. Regarding the setting, it was more telling than showing. (Don't get me wrong, though-- the feelings were perfectly shown.)This has to be one of the best reads of 2023, and I love it. This is such a good book, and I need to go have a lie-down now for how good it was. To be honest, I'm scared of starting another book after this because I don't want it to spoil the taste of the Telegraph Club! (Now, who wants to sneak out with me in the middle of the night to sneak off to some club where we can watch a nice show and fall desperately in love? Anyone?)  Lily wächst in Chinatown in San Francisco auf, zwischen den Erwartungen ihrer eingewanderten Eltern und dem gesellschaftlichen Druck der amerikanischen Gesellschaft der 50er Jahre. Als sie bei einem Schulprojekt Kath kennenlernt, wird ihr klar, dass sie anders fühlt, als von ihr erwartet wird. Gemeinsam besuchen sie nachts heimlich den Telegraph Club, eine geheime Bar für Lesben, in der eine Herrenimitatorin auftritt.Die Geschichte dieses Buches wird sehr ruhig und herrlich unaufgeregt erzählt. In den meisten Szenen folgen wir einfach nur Lilys alltäglichem Leben. Was auf den ersten Blick langweilig wirken könnte, zeigt tatsächlich so viele Aspekte des Lebens in den 50er Jahren als junge, mehrfach marginalisierte Person. Lily und ihre Familie müssen eine Menge Rassismus über sich ergehen lassen. Bei einigen Dingen war ich geschockt, was damals als normal galt, bei anderen Dingen traurig, denn es würde mich nicht wundern, wenn so etwas auch heute noch geschehen würde. Gleichzeitig erlebt Lily aber auch, was von ihr als Frau erwartet wird und wie die Gesellschaft auf Abweichungen davon reagiert.Gerade die Perspektive der mehrfachen Marginalisierung fand ich im Buch sehr gut ausgearbeitet, da Lily Probleme hat, einen Platz zu finden, zu welchem sie sich vollständig zugehörig fühlen darf. Es gibt in diesem Zusammenhang einige gute Diskussionen über Rassismus und Queerfeindlichkeit, aber diese scheinen immer getrennt voneinander abzulaufen – das Buch zeigt jedoch, dass diese Trennung an der Lebenswirklichkeit von Lily vorbeiläuft.In diesem Zusammenhang gefiel mir auch das Nachwort der Autorin, in welcher sie ihre Recherchearbeit näher erläutert. Dies gibt dem ganzen Text noch einmal eine stärkere Wirkung. Auch die Übersetzerin hat eine kurze Anmerkung geschrieben, wie sie die historisch korrekte Sprache angepasst hat, um zum einen die deutlich negativer behafteten deutschen Worte zu vermeiden, andererseits aber nicht zu neueren Worten zu greifen, die Charaktere der Zeit nicht verwendet hätten.Fazit:Mich konnte die Geschichte rund um Lily und Kath absolut überzeugen. Schon für sich genommen ist es eine schöne Coming of Age Story, doch in Verbindung mit der historischen Komponente und der Tatsache, dass einiges der gezeigten Diskriminierung auch heute noch relevant ist, empfinde ich dieses Buch als sehr wichtig. Ich möchte es daher unbedingt weiterempfehlen!  A story about a young Chinese American navigating her way through being gay in 1950's SF, which, as we could possibly imagine, is about a thousand steps harder than it being a teenager should be. Lily was 16 when she met Kath, whom she clicked with immediately. She knew immediately that she was different from the others, but like her. Things change when Kath offers to bring her to the Telegraph Club.What I liked was the realistically painted picture of realising you are gay and having to hide away while trying to figure out who you are. Her friendship with Shirley really stuck with me - the juxtaposition of having a friendship built on time and shared experiences of being a minority, yet having to navigate hatred and homophobia from the same friend. I also had friends like Shirley and it was painfully realistic.  In the story, Shirley lashed out and dropped Lily when she found out she was friends with Kath after Shirley warned her that Kath was friends with a lesbian (even just the association...!). After a period, Shirley acted like everything was back to normal and invited Lily for lunch, but throughout the lunch, she seemed to be testing whether Lily was straight by asking leading questions and dropping microaggressions towards gay people.The historical aspect of finding queer, safe spaces in the 1950s is really informative. Bars continue to be that space, though in the Telegraph Club you still see straights clutching their pearls at the scandalous male impersonators and lesbian behaviour (seriously, just leave). Lily experiences the added barrier of racism, as clubgoers make comments about her 'orientalism' and infantalises her.I found the writing not very compelling, unfortunately, and I think it needs another round of editing. There were lots of threads that seemingly got dropped  (the fears about being deported, accusations of communism, her parents' flashback story which was quite awkwardly dropped in), and I found the ending quite rushed and unsatisfying. I wanted to know how they kept up their relationship long distance? How did Lily feel and deal with moving away? Did she keep in touch with her older queer friends?? But alas it was literally just one chapter, a done and dusted deal.Didn't quite like it though I wished I did.  Malinda Lo hat mit Last Night at the Telegraph Club 2021 den National Book Award for Young People‘s Literature gewonnen - in Deutschland hat sie seit Erscheinen des Buches am 20.04.23 3 Rezensionen auf Amazon. Gleich sind es 4. sehr traurig für ein Buch, das so wertvoll ist. Es geht in diesem Buch um eine junge Liebe zwischen zwei Mädchen. Lily entdeckt ihre Gefühle als sie Kath kennenlernt. Sie wächst in den 50er Jahren in China Town auf, parallel erfahren wir viel darüber, wie die politische Entwicklung damals voranschritt und die Traditionen der Menschen mit asiatischen Wurzeln. Der Telegraph Club wird der Safe Space für Lily und die Gefühle, die sie erst noch verstehen muss. Neben Gesellschaftskritik behandelt das Buch auch emotionale Themen, die jugendliche queere Menschen durchleben müssen. Frauenbilder, über die wir heutzutage den Kopf schütteln gepaart mit den Strapazen des Erwachsenwerdens, die uns Menschen bis zum Weltuntergang begleiten werden.Ich habe in den Seiten viel über den Kommunismus und die Politik in den 50er Jahren gelernt. Doch was zum Teil immer noch bleibt ist die Homophobie unserer Gesellschaft. Der Weg in die tolerante Richtung in der heutigen Zeit ist gut und doch zeigt das Buch auf, dass zu viele Menschen noch in diesen veralteten Rollenbildern stecken. Last Night at the Telegraph Club ist ein tolles und aufklärendes Jugendbuch mit wertvollen Messages, die wir auch in der heutigen Zeit dringend brauchen. Ich habe sehr mit Lily gelitten und geliebt. Auch sprachlich hat die Autorin so viel aus diesem Buch gemacht. Es ist anspruchsvoll geschrieben und doch sehr gut für Jugendliche geeignet.Ihr findet, dass wir dringend mehr Sapphic Books brauchen? Dann lest diese Bücher! Dieses ist ein sehr gutes Beispiel für ein richtig tolles Jugendbuch mit lesbischen Hauptfiguren, die beeindrucken und nachhallen.  Last Night at the Telegraph Club: 4.5/5I read this book in one sitting. Last Night at the Telegraph Club is a young adult novel that takes place in 1950s China Town, Sanfransico. It is a coming of age novel for a young Chinese girl who is coming to terms with her queer identity in a world brimming with panic and homophobia. Within this time, a bar called The Telegraph club serves as a safe place for those who are queer or questioning, and Lily finds her own refuge here.This novel is simply beautiful. As a child of a Chinese immigrant family, I found myself in this novel and really could see my thoughts, beliefs, and struggles within Lily's journey to find herself. This is one of many reasons I believe many people will connect with this book. I think it provides such a unique experience that so many people will identify with, which makes this book so important.Malinda Lo's writing is extremely approachable and easy to follow. I'm someone who definitely struggles to remember characters, but I did not have this issue with this book. Malinda Lo beautifully painted these characters as flawed, beautiful, and extremely memorable. I fell in love with everyone I met because all the characters feel so real. Furthermore, Malinda Lo beautifully outlines an authentic lesbian experience as well as touching upon the struggles a young Chinese woman has to combat to accept this identity within herself and justify it to those around her. The only reason this has 4.5/5 stars is because there are some blatant plot holes and some topics that are brought up and not discussed again. The reader is led to believe some topics will introduce some kind of conflict and they never come back into the story. This really didnt hinder much of the experience reading this book though. Malinda Lo makes up for it with everything else, but I cant ignore it in my review.I 100% recommend this book to anyone and everyone. In fact, please read it. Thanks.   Oh, this book is so good!It centers on mid-century Chinatown in San Francisco, where 17-year-old Lily Hu is about to discover something about herself that will change the entire course of her life. I watched, with growing excitement and not a little recognition, as Lily slowly starts to piece the puzzle of her own queerness together. That my own coming-out happened in the early 1990s and repeated a lot of the same patterns both comforts and appalls me. In Lily's terror of her desires, her reluctances and hesitations, her insane mood shifts, I absolutely saw myself. I just wish that in the intervening forty years, things had changed a little more.But Lily's got the deck stacked against her in a lot of other ways. 1. She's a woman. 2. She's a Chinese-American (in the book, Caucasian characters call her an "Oriental," which was common enough back then and not necessarily considered an insult, but I liked that Lily bristles at the othering term, just the same), and 3. She's living in the 1950s, when being either of those things was more than a little suspect. I liked that author Malinda Lo didn't spend too long on the male gaze or the T R A G E D Y of homosexuality. I sometimes find in books and movies that depict queer people of different eras, it all has to be about SADNESS and LONGING and PUNISHMENT. Even progressive stuff in the 70s had lonely people dying alone, in the 80s and 90s had AIDS as a finale to too many lives, in the aughts had feints toward cohesive stories that always fell in the shadows of their heterosexual counterparts (and sometimes murder and torture). It long stunned me that one of the best and most progressive depictions of gay people I found in a 1980s novel was in Stephen King's It, which edges into stereotype and ends in brutal murder.What I've long wanted is a book that gave a historical context for a queer existence and a queer relationship that recognized the dangers of the day without necessarily giving into them. Sometimes Lily's reluctance and nervousness frustrated me, but of course I understood all of that. How strange was it for young me discovering what it is about men I liked, and being repulsed by myself and afraid about who I was? How infinitely more strange it would be for someone like Lily Hu, and for the girl she starts to fall in love with. I first saw this book on my last trip into New York, and ... I think I bought it for Tracey? Or she had already read it and couldn't stop gushing over it. I kept texting her throughout my read with stuff like, "BAD THINGS BETTER NOT HAPPEN TO THESE LESBIANS." I loved Lily Hu. I loved her friend Kath. I loved this book.  Hm. Ich weiss ja nicht so recht, was ich über das Buch sagen soll.Vor allem in Angesicht des riesigen Hypes und den unglaublich guten Bewertungen.Ich verstehe, wieso viele das Buch so gut finden. Die Hauptfigur ist ein chinesisch-amerikanisches Mädchen, das Setting ist San Francisco der 50er, es geht um die Findung der Sexualität... Quasi ein perfektes Rezept für einen Bestseller.Für mich hat es aber überhaupt nicht funktioniert.Vielleicht liegt es an mangelnden Ähnlichkeiten zwischen Lily und mir (Lily: Amerikanerin mit chinesischen Wurzeln, 17, 50er-Jahre, Nachtclubs, Luca: Schweizerin, 26, 2020er-Jahre, wenn ich nach 20 Uhr noch aus dem Haus muss bin ich grumpy af).Vielleicht auch an den Flashbacks, die uns zu Lily's Eltern und ihrer Tante führen. Die haben die Immersion jedes Mal gestört, und irgendwann habe ich die Abschnitte vollständig übersprungen.Vielleicht liegt es auch daran, dass mehrere Sachen am Anfang zum Teil sehr stark als "Achtung, wichtig!" deklariert wurden, und im Endeffekt hatten sie nur mässig viel Einfluss.Jedenfalls war der Telegraph Club nicht mein Fall. Ich mochte Lily's Charakterentwicklung gerne, wie sie von der, sorry für die Ausdrucksweise, rückgratslosen Mitläuferin zu einem Mädchen wird, das sich gegen ihre Eltern auflehnt. Aber das war auch das Einzige, was ich wirklich an der Geschichte mochte. Das Buch würde ich aber vor allem jüngeren Personen trotzdem empfehlen, einfach für den neuen Blickwinkel der queeren Community der 50er Jahre. Also auch bei diesem Buch gilt: Luca ist auf ein TikTok-Hype reingefallen. Obwohl sie's wirklich besser wissen sollte. Zu meiner Verteidigung, ich habe erst gesehen, dass es sich um einen TikTok-Hype handelt, nachdem mir das Leseexemplar zur Verfügung gestellt wurde.@DTV und Netgalley: Danke für dieses Leseexemplar  A gorgeous coming-of-age novel that follows Lily Hu, a young Chinese-American girl who finds herself in the crossroads of what it means to be a queer Asian-American in 1950's USA. This novel was a delight from start to finish and easily one of the best lesbian novels I've read in a long time. As I read, it felt clear to me that Lo had done her research and, perhaps more important, deeply cared for her characters and the story she was crafting for them. As we follow Lily's journey of self-discovery, Lo reminds us of the beauty, power, and complexity of communities- through different POV's, we learn how Chinese-American identity differs tremendously between Lily, her parents, and her friends. As she's ushered into the secret world of lesbian bars and the drag scene, we're forced to sit with the discomfort of white lesbians calling Lily a "china girl" and assuming she cannot speak English. The intersections of race, gender, and sexuality are the meat of this novel, but Lo impressed me with the organic and masterful way she broached these thematic subjects. Through careful characterization and great narrative pacing, Lo shows, she doesn't tell. This book is a pleasure precisely because of this. All of the novel's characters feel fully fleshed: flawed, complicated, and utterly human. The core relationship between Lily and Kath, a classmate who recognizes herself in Lily's burgeoning queerness, was compelling and sweet. I'm especially impressed with the tasteful use of sexual intimacy in this novel. Sometimes, in response to long and troublesome histories of fetishization of queer women and AFAB folks, authors sanitize their narratives. It's refreshing to see an author acknowledge the many teenaged girls have sexual desires and even fulfilling and pleasurable sexual experiences. I feel so happy for young queer girls who have representation of this caliber. I'd just advise readers to be aware that this novel includes some realistic depictions of familial homophobia and it isn't exactly dismissed by the end of the novel, though the novel ends on a hopeful note. If you're in a good headspace to read this, I strongly encourage it- this is an absolutely beautiful book.   4.25 out of 5 stars
  "Isn't it strange that nobody in our regular lives knows about it? That they think we're at home asleep?""Well, you don't want them to know, do you?""No," Lily said quickly. Of course, she didn't want anyone in her regular life to know. The very thought of it was horrifying. No, it was better to do this in secret.
Last Night at the Telegraph Club paints a very good picture of what it might be like coming out as queer, not only in the 1950s when homosexuality was deemed as a mental illness, but also as an Asian American with a traditional family during a political turmoil.Her family and society expects Lily Hu to be a good Chinese girl. But all Lily wants is to someday be able to build rocket ships and to freely spend time with Kath at the Telegraph Club, a discreet club where all the gay women can freely be themselves.+This book was an easy read but still beautifully written. Although it does feel like a "slight plot, mostly vibes". There are a few passages that I could consider relatable, even now, not just with the attitude towards queerness but also towards racism, culture, and tradition.Characters were well written. You can easily dislike certain characters, specifically the mom and Shirley but the author still does a good job of showing a few good aspects about them that humanizes them.It's a good book, although the actual story climax felt a bit... anticlimactic.  I absolutely love this book. I absolutely love queer historical fiction and this is one of my top favourites now. I also learned a lot about the Red Scare in the US( because I never properly learned about this in school as I live in the Netherlands) though the eyes of Lily. A young Chinese American girl living with her family in San Fransisco's Chinatown in the 1950s. Her discovering her sexuality and coming to terms with her identity was such a wonderful journey to go on. It was realistic and she definitely dealt with tons of internalised homophobia. But it was also beautiful and hopeful. The queer found family vibes especially within the Telegraph Club and everyone she meets there was just incredible.I am also obsessed with Lily and Kath. Their relationship was so beautifully developed. They cared so much for eachother and were so respectful and wonderful together. Everytime they were on the page together I got all the feelings and emotions.I also adored Malinda Lo's writing style. The descriptions of San Francisco, Chinatown, Lily's apartment and mostly the Telegraph Club made me visualise it all so well. Also the food descriptions had me so hungry. And there were so many beautiful and relatable quotes !!!This book was realistic for a story about a Chinese American lesbian teenage girl living in the 1950s in the US, but the underlying tone was definitely hope. It wasn't all tragic but also wasn't afraid to shy away from the truthThe story also showed in so many different ways how important (good) representation is and how much that can help and shape a person and coming to terms with who they are and their sexuality  This book was so gentle and an excruciatingly accurate depiction of the life of a lesbian Chinese immigrant in 1950s America. Although this label sounds lengthy, the portrayal of this story was both nuanced and a broad critic of society which never gave you any answers; it left you thinking: what would I be doing in this time? would I be trapped in the anxiety of the decade or cracking the fragile walls of tradition? I found the young romance had a slightly weak build up and didn’t allow for me to form an emotional attachment to the relationship between Lily and Kath. Although it can be argued that the romantic portion of the novel is not the highlight of the text, and rather leans farther into historical fiction than a romance. So I believe my yearning for a gooey gay romance may be impacting how i perceived the approach of the relationship. I got a little teary-eyed and began feeling the genuine connection between the two girls in the last few pages of the book which made for a satisfying ending.Overall I give this book a 4.5/5 and will just round up to 5💅💅  [🐉🌈🎤] " Perhaps that was the most perverse part of this: the inside-outness of everything, as if denial would make it go away, when it only made the pain in her chest tighten, when it only made her emotions clearer. " rating : ⭐⭐⭐⭐/5This story was set in the 50's in America. It's beautiful as well as heartbreaking. I really liked the main character, Lily. Following her story and the way she discovers who she is and who she wants to be was both empowering and heart-shattering.It was an amazing read that was quite difficult to put down. We have Lily’s pov, but some chapters were written in her parents’ and auntie’s povs. We get to see their own stories as Chinese immigrants in the U.S. during the time, which was very interesting. I also like Kathy, the love interest, i just wish we saw more about her. The romance was beautifully written and this book made go through all kind of emotions.I also really liked the author's writing. The description of Chinatown, the food ( 😩 ), and all the places Lily visits. The descriptions are very rich and it truly felt like I was a time-traveler. This book is about self-discovery, being true to yourself, first love, following your dreams, taking risks and believing yourself as well as what you can achieve.( trigger warning: racism, homophobia, xenophobia, miscarriage, lesbophobia. )  4 stars. I liked the concept, I love queer historical fiction, and overall it was an interesting and clearly well researched book. It took me a little while to get into the writing style; it's very show-not-tell, but to an extent that I felt like I wasn't getting all the details and metaphors. Luckily, I did adjust to it maybe 100-150 pages in, and from then on it was easier to read. I really liked how the author used timelines and flashbacks to previous years from different characters' perspectives to add to Lily's story, and I especially liked Judy's chapters. I do wish both she and Shirley got more of a conclusion, since I like Judy and although I don't like Shirley, she's a complicated character, it's hard to figure out her motivations and thoughts, and I wish that paid off a little more. As far as Lily and Kath's ending, it was good, I just wish that last timeline had a little more information to wrap the whole thing up. Overall, it's definitely not a happy, fast-paced, or action-filled book, but it's a really good, emotional story that deals with some heavy topics, and I thought it was very well done. TWs: homophobia (particularly from family members), racism, descriptions of war and violence  This book was just solid. It is outside the realm of what I normally read, but I can see why many people really like this book. I really felt the need and desperation from the characters and I wanted them to succeed. I liked the setting and the premise of struggling not only with racism and sexism but also with homophobia. It was kind of eye opening to see how people from that time period treated not only non-Americans but also women and homosexuals. I didn't really get the time skips between Lily's perspective and the others. I would have preferred to not have those at all. I also felt like the inclusion of the Ma-Ting was not needed, it was just too much. Overall, a good story though and I would recommend reading it.  dnf at p.191.I might eventually come back to it ?I really wanted to like this. And I think I could’ve finished it. But it would have taken me forever, because I don’t care about any of the characters. There seems to be a phenomenal amount of research that has been done in the writing of this book which is really awesome. However, it felt to me as if the «&nbsp;academic/research&nbsp;» part kinda took precedence on the depth of the characters, and the fleshing out of the plot. I guess I can guess where this is going but it’s getting sooooooo slowly that it doesn’t retain my attention. The setting and premise seemed so good, but the execution fell flat for me.   4.5"The Last Night At The Telegraph Club" is a well-written novel about being a Chinese-American lesbian in the 1950s. it has forbidden love but, in my opinion, is not solely centered around the romance of Kath and Lily. I believe it focuses on being accepted, finding people who love you, and the struggles of being queer, including other things as well. I really loved this book, however, there was something missing. Nearing the end of the book, my chest was tightening, waiting for something to happen. Well, something did happen, but it wasn't what I wanted. If I'm completely honest, I don't know what I wanted. Overall, I liked this book and will recommend it to people. It had a good plot, and characters, I liked the setting and the message. As author Emily X.R. Pan said, "This book is for anyone who was ever loved-in any sense of the word."  So maybe this was just overhyped to me because I definitely went in thinking this would become one of my favourite reads ever but while it was good, I definitely wouldn't consider it great. It's very, very, slow with a lot of the plot happening in the last little bit of the book and while a slow pace can sometimes help you connect to the reader or the core relationship (especially in historical romances) Kath kind of just felt like a manic-pixie-dream girl if you made the trope historical and queer so I was never as invested in the romances as I wanted to be.  fofo demais!! minha parte favorita foi saber mais sobre o contexto histórico da época e a realidade das mulheres LGBTQIA+, ainda mais dentro do recorte de americanos descendentes de chineses :) quero ler mais livros dessa autora, gostei muito das descrições e em alguns momentos consegui visualizar perfeitamente a cena!! só não consigo dar 5 estrelas por conta dos capítulos que contavam sobre a família dela, achei que acabou não acrescentando muito na história e tirou um pouco do meu foco enquanto lia.  I like how the historical and romance elements were entwined, but can't help but be disappointed by an ending that is simply too convenient. When faced with a crisis, the main character simply stumped her feet and never even acknowledged the consequences her selfish choices might bring to other people in her family. It's a shame, really, because you'd have thought everything was building up precisely so Lily would have to sacrifice something in order to develop, or that we'd at least get some reflection into the complexities of the political scene she found herself immersed into. I crave the book this could have been.  there was so much to love about this book … the characters were well developed and showed growth, and i really enjoyed lily’s perspective and voice. the setting was so detailed and thoroughly researched, so the historical aspect of the novel was spot on. i also loved how lo seamlessly sprinkled in cantonese and mandarin throughout the novel, with footnotes for understanding the meanings. the book felt incredibly real overall. lily and kath have my heart ❤️   this was beautiful. probably one of the BEST written young peoples relationships !!! portrayed emotions of excitement, fear, passion and just SO much love for one another. additionally the historical context was so interesting. reading about a queer chinese girl was incred as it’s just not written about enough. the ending chapters about family were especially heartbreaking but im glad they didn’t sugarcoat the realties for some people and it was a far more accurate rep for the time.  also the ending. sobbing.  2.5—3 stars if i had to compare this book to anything it would be to that feeling when you're under water and you hear the sounds muffled. like when you know things are happening but you're not able to full connect with them. it wasn't a "bad book" because at points i was invested (granted, it was past the mark of 300 pages) but it wasn't enough. it was a bit underwhelming. i am glad that eventually it ends how it ends but then again, it feels like it's lacking a lot of things. the process seems too weak to end with that statement, idk. anyway, at least it was nicely written and easy to follow. if only it sparked some interested to actually want to keep reading.  3.7, rounding up to 4 I did not want to put this book down. I wouldn’t say that I LOVED it, but I REALLY REALLY SUPER LIKED it. I’d recommend this to a teen trying to understand their sexuality. I thought it was a great coming out story in the presence of other complicating factors, like being “a good Chinese daughter”, without being too heavy. 10 bonus points to anyone who will find me a sequel to Lily and Katy’s story.   Ein einfühlsamer Roman über die erste große Liebe im San Francisco der 50er. Ich fand die Geschichte sehr schön erzählt (die Flashbacks zum Rest der Familie waren allerdings manchmal eher ablenkend), und das historische Setting war richtig gut recherchiert und dargestellt (das Nachwort der Autorin war für mich super interessant). Das Ende kam mir allerdings etwas zu abrupt. Aber sonst absolut empfehlenswert! *Leseexemplar vom Verlag via NetGalley erhalten*  Read this for online book club and I really enjoyed this YA coming of age story. Some in the group felt it moved slowly and really there was not a lot of plot, but the writing style transported me right back to my teenage years, before I worked and could spend most of my days reading. Set in San Francisco in the mid 1950s, Malinda Lo writes about Asian and Asian American prejudice and racism and LGBTQ youth. I really enjoyed the characters and I didn't even mind the loose ends. This book was not on my radar, but I am so glad Clint picked it!  Ahh this was really good but I don’t know what to rate it so I’ll have to think about that some more. Here are some of my thoughts, though:- such an important and at times difficult read - about a time period I really didn’t know a lot about but was very interesting - very well written and researched   O G R O M N E 5/5Świetna książka, każdy musi ją przeczytać (chociaż spróbować).Po epilogu czułam się niezmiernie pusta ale to uczucie zapełniły inofmracje od autorki, które były nasiąknięte informacjami o sytuacji historycznej danego okresu, o chińskich Amerykanach, jak i o społeczności homoseksualnej. Książka świetnie przezntuje realia życia osób homosekualnych w latach 50. XX wieku.  this was clearly super well researched and i enjoyed it so much, my heart !! lost a little half star because i wished that there was more substance to the relationship between lily and her romantic interest, but this didn’t really take away from my overall enjoyment of the book ~ 9/10  extremely sweet and earnest and compassionate in its exploration of the impacts of the lavender &amp; red scares on the life of chinese american coming to understand her queerness! felt well-researched and historically grounded, but still expansive and imaginative. honest, but not bleak. i love queer history!  książka pokazywała prawdziwe zdarzenia (niestety nie za bardzo szczęśliwe), ale moim zdaniem to zakończenie było trochę... nierealne? Jakby po roku nic sie nie zmieniło, jakby nie widziały sie tylko przez jakiś weekend Book Riot 2021 Task: Read a historical fiction with a POC or LGBTQ+ protagonistAmerica in 1954 is not a safe place for two girls to fall in love, especially not in Chinatown. Red-Scare paranoia threatens everyone, including Chinese Americans like Lily. With deportation looming over her father--despite his hard-won citizenship--Lily and Kath risk everything to let their love see the light of day.  Honest, well written historical fiction set in 1950's San Francisco. The author's research and family history is reflected in this bittersweet story of a Chinese-American teenager coming of age during the height of the Red Scare and also coming to terms with her blossoming lesbian sexuality. Highly recommend!  Such a good book wow it’s literally homophobic how underrated this book is. rtc The gays really need to read this one. I love historical stories about the sapphics. I want more. I love knowing the gays have been here 5ever. *4.5my heart is full of intense emotions, i'm going through it. (also i highlighted some lines on the author's note. i really love it when authors show us how passionate they are in creating their stories. it makes me want to rate this book five stars for that alone. this book truly captures me, i will remember this one for a while)  3,75 this! book! wow. lots of thoughts, i’m a little overwhelmed. i loved it, i wish i could’ve read this in high school.  Was quite pleasantly surprised by the ending I was prepared for the worst. Still teared up though. 4.25! Cudowna, smutna i prawdziwa historia ⭐️ 3,5a nota da autora no final muito incrível. gostei bastante do livro, muito rico em detalhes!!!  cudowna 🥹 4.5 ⭐️This was magnificent. Instant favourite. Wow.  this book was a beautiful queer romance novel set in the backdrop of 1950s San Francisco. The protagonist is a Chinese American high school senior figuring out how to hold all her identities in a time that wasn’t ready for her. I loved it and wanted it to continue when it ended.  4 ⭐️ very descriptive writing. i liked reading about what gay bars were like in the 1950s. i felt like i learned a lot about the era. Kocham to LETS GO LESBIANS! In all seriousness this one had me living for Lily and stressing for her and being so sad for her all at once. 4.5 stars !!!! OH HOW I LOVED THIS BOOK!!! truly! Lily she is just like me fr ! (gay) but No seriously all jokes aside i found so much of myself in lily and just in this book in general, both as someone who also loves girls 💗! and as an asian-american, not to mention how happy the (although brief) mentions of filipinos made me!! and filipino lesbians AAAA!!! i especially enjoyed the end where i learned lots about the history of this time period, as well as the setting and ofcourse lesbians and more :,) truly wonderful, the only thing that felt as though it came up a bit short for me was kath’s character :( i feel as though i probably wouldn’t have paid much attention to this if i hadn’t read previous reviews mentioning it but it is something i felt a bit sad about since i felt as if i barely knew anything about her at all but knew so much abt lily ? (which i’m not mad about tho!!!!) but i loved all the characters nonetheless! i especially loved aunt judy as well oh She’s so cool and just yeah! so much of lily’s thoughts and feelings truly resonated with me and made me reflect on myself, i still truly do not know how i feel about shirley though….. but never mind that im so happy to have finished this bookkk!!!! i have much more to say but i am also sadly not very good with words and i hope this review gives this book at least some justice bc it truly was amazing :,)  Kocham, kocham i jeszcze raz kocham 3.5 ⭐️ I could not put this book down. Such an incredible period piece! It simultaneously made my heart swell and then rip it out of my chest and step on it repeatedly. I want to go clubbing with Lily and Kath so badly and then give them the biggest hugs The reading of this book was such a task, I can't believe I even got to the end of it. If not for me not liking to DNF books, I would've given up on this one a long time ago. I just feel like everything we were promised in the synopsis was not delivered. If not for the audiobook, it would have taken me twice the time to read it. The story dragged on and, for me, by the time I reached the halfway point, it was like I already read too much yet nothing at all. I didn't really like the main character and we didn't get to know the love interested enough for me to form an opinion about her. Not to mention the threats made throughout the whole book that seemed important but ended up not really leading anywhere. I will not be reading the next one.  4.5 Last Night at the Telegraph Club is decent YA, albeit boring and too long. The story centers around character A, (forgettable characters with surface level personalities... I did not care about literally one of the characters in this book) a Chinese teenage girl living in China Town with her immigrant parents and brothers. Watching her peers transform into coupled pairs and boy crazy mares (it rhymed), she soon realizes that she harbors some of that good ole lesbian predilection. Her best friend is a heteronormative and exclusive baddie who dreams of becoming Miss Chinatown. Their relationship relies on surface level interactions and childhood nostalgia... no spoiler needed, you can probably guess how this storyline ends. Anyways, we watch as she finds love with character B, a cutie from school who breaks all gendered barriers by liking airplanes and having short hair. Soon, they begin sneaking out at night to visit the local lesbian bar, The Telegraph Club. BUT, a twist of fate, this is the 1950's and being gay means being persecuted by society, the government, police, etc. Furthermore, character A is Chinese and Americans are racist as hell so, naturally, suspect all Asians of harboring communist ties. This situation threatens Character A and Character B's love, as well as character A's family. It's a whole thing, there are coming-out scenes, there's drama, there are police raids on the lesbian bar, there's a surprise (not so surprising if you're familiar with queer history) ending. I know, it sounds good, but unfortunately, the YA nature of the story left gaping holes in the storyline, stones unturned, situations described in a way that would have been significantly more interesting with more detail, and just a general sense of disappointment at the book that could have existed if this was written for adults. The positives do exist. This is some YA that would not have existed back in my high school days that could have potentially expedited many of my fellow queers' coming out experiences...I mean, most of us didn't even realize any of this was an option back then and if we did, we only had negative propaganda-based representation. Lo also refuses to ignore the rampant racism that existed on the lesbian scene, with many older white lesbians calling character A "china doll" or "the oriental." This was refreshing, as many older white queer stories don't acknowledge racism. So, as far as good representation goes, this may be some of the best YA right now (if you can deal with boring writing, dialogue, and plot holes.) I do understand the hype on this premise and do believe the book stands on good merit. Side note on gender in the book:I did not appreciate the constricting gendered boundaries that each lesbian couple was placed within. There was always a butch and a femme. The over representation of couples in popular media who exist within the strict gender binary, whether those are queer couples (who subvert gender mores by enacting the opposite gender from their sex, I.e. butch/studs/dykes) or straight couples (man/woman pairing), leads to a popular imagination of romantic pairings as Yin Yang-esque relationships. Each must contain components of masculinity and femininity to be considered truly whole. This leads to a rather confusing situation for queer folks (or even straight couples with feminine presenting men or masculine presenting women) wherein they do not experience representation in media. This lack of representation leads to a societal response to these couples that entails confusion, questioning, and an overarching desire to place these couples within the binary. “Are you the top or the bottom?” “Are you the man or the woman?” This is no fault of butch/femme individuals, as they are existing within the representations of gender they appreciate and feel comfortable with. The same goes for man/woman straight couples. The problem, therefore, lays in the often unspoken demands for conformity that arise from the over representation of couples in the binary. Some examples include, of course, Last Night at the Telegraph Club and the reality tv show Tampa Baes. Both are very popular queer media that almost solely represent butch/femme dynamics. One may be hard pressed to find a queer show or book that doesn’t overly represent this gendered dynamic, although it’s probably getting easier with the recent pushback against the binary. This over representation creates gender dysphoria for those trapped in enacting the role of one gender, who don’t wish to abide by such strict guidelines of existence, who love someone gender non-conforming, or who are gender non-conforming themself. The cure may be greater diversity in the representation of coupled pairs (both queer and straight) and greater appreciation for those couples, rather than the abolition of the social structure of gender itself.  five bloody stars!!i loved this book so much! i have felt every single emotion while reading this book. after reading 'the seven husbands of evelyn hugo' i was desperate for another historical fiction book with sapphic romance in it and guess what? this book totally served it. it's perfect.i loved the mc lily so much! hers was one of the best character developments ever written. the way she was so self conscious,scared and confused at first but then went to stand up for herself and what she believed in at the end made me feel so proud of her. i got SO attached to lily and her struggles. this book not only focused on lily's confusion and discovering of her sexuality but also focused on the problems she faced because of her race as she was a chinese american living in the us. it also showed us the complications among family members and the problems in a friendship.i was cheering for lily and kath the whole time. their relationship was so perfectly portrayed. from getting to know each other,being friends and then falling in love! it felt so raw and beautiful!i loved and adored every bit of this book. the writing was so immaculate. this book broke my heart into pieces and put them back in. it made me laugh out loud, cry my eyes out, angry, excited all at once. definitely recommend this book to everyone who liked 'the seven husbands of evelyn hugo'.  oh 😭 :'))) this book is so good.it’s set in 1950’s america and centered around a 17yr old chinese girl lily as she begins to discover herself and find her first love, kath. it deals with a lot of problems during the time like lesbian fetishisation, homophobia, racial boundaries and chinese communism and how it affected chinese american people. the romance is perfectly paced and the girls’ interactions were as awkward and realistic as a forbidden first love would be expected to be. (also the first smut i havent skipped in a while having just read ugly love lmao)it also has a informational section at the end that delves deeper into the historical context (e.g. ideas of gender and sexuality in the 50s and the laws surrounding it, how chinese americans were deported etc)definitely worth a read,, the non fictional parts are just as good as the fictional :))  Holy effing god this book was absolutely amazing! I could tell that this was super well researched for the time period and every single feeling and emotion felt real. Did not love that ending, but I adored everything else! I almost cried twice reading it 💕 3.5 stars This book follows 17-year-old Lily Hu on her journey of self-discovery, growing up and identifying as lesbian, navigating San Francisco in the 1950s as a Chinese American amidst McCarthyism and the Red Scare.I’ve never read a book that captures a time and place so well. Rooted in history, real-life people, places, and events, this book is brilliantly executed. All the characters and their experiences, from high school and first crushes to citizenship and familial expectations, it all feels very real. Naturally, I also enjoyed Lily’s love of science and her interest in working on the first rockets to go into space.The first half of this book can feel a little dense because it is very descriptive, but the pace does pick up in the second half.Grounded in historic details and accuracy, centered on self-discovery and identity, this book is ideal for those that enjoy character-driven and detail-oriented novels.  3 starsI really enjoyed reading this. The story was emotional and heart breaking. The characters were very well written, but the writing just fell short for me.  I love when girls. that’s it, that’s the review 🛩️💖 *4.5⭐️I couldn’t stop reading!  I’m so glad we finally have a lesbian story without any men involved!! Love it 10/10.My comfort book Malinda Lo’s historical novel Last Night at the Telegraph  (Dutton Books for Young Readers, 2021) is set in 1950s San Francisco. Lily is a Chinese-American high school senior living with her family in Chinatown when a newspaper advertisement for a nightclub act starring male impersonator Tommy Edwards catches her eye. Lily doesn’t completely understand her attraction to females, but knowing there are other girls and young women who feel similarly is a kind of comfort to her. As Lily follows her impulses, she is at odds with her family’s expectations and her circle of friends. Just as Lily and her new friends are ostracized for their lesbianism, Lily’s family and neighbors are constantly in fear of being considered communists and threatened with deportation. These threads lead readers to consider what we might take for granted about our own identities, and how willing we are to embrace and defend who we are, and are not. Malindo Lo writes with sensitivity and insight about Lily’s feelings, and creates hauntingly atmospheric scenes at the Telegraph Club, a nightclub that caters to gay women. Last Night at the Telegraph Club is a love story that will appeal to readers who want to be absorbed into a setting and situation that are both historically compelling and relevant to current-day American teens.  YESSSSSS HAPPY ENDING OMG I WAS SO SCARED FOR A SECOND. First of all I just wanna say FUCK SHIRLEY… and secondly FUCK HOMOPHOBES. Ok that’s all. Oh and this book was GLORIOUS, it took me a while to finish it but I’m happy I did. The slow burn between Kath and Lily was PERFECT, and my heart was near pounding in the end. I kinda wish the ending was a bit different but it was realistic. Kath is absolutely adorable. LILY IS MY BEST FRIEND BTW, THAT GURL FINNA BUILD A WHOLE ROCKET ONE DAY, MY SPACE GIRL.  i wasn’t going to read this book when i first heard about it because i’m not a big fan of reading about homophobia and i knew this book would be full of it being set in the 1960s. i have only heard positive things about this book however so i decided to give it a chance thinking the good would out way the bad. it did not. the first 250 pages of this book were boring and mindless. the main characters had no personality and i felt more inclined to the “bad” characters like shirley than the main love interest, kath. there was no chemistry between the two girls, and lily’s self discovery was just badly written. i understand that the author was trying to make it a subtle thing lily was blocking away in her mind and not thinking about directly, but it really came across as bad development. also kath didn’t have any personality whatsoever past being interested in piloting and an aspiring butch. like there was no dynamic when lily and her spoke, it honestly didn’t even feel like they were friends for any reason other than the fact that they were both lesbian. i just couldn’t understand why lily liked kath over any other girl she talked to. it feels like she fell for her simply because she was the one who took her to the telegraph club, which i know was important to her and a valid reason but it didn’t even seem like she liked her a lot.when they did get together it was nice. like the first stages of being in love was written nicely but it wasn’t really special. i don’t have much to say about that.the telegraph club wasn’t even cool. i understand the importance of it obviously but it didn’t even seem appealing. all the women there were just racist towards lily, making her (or at least the reader) feel out of place in the only place that would accept her sexuality. none of the characters she met here were likeable except for lana. i understand the racism in this book, but you can add some likeable aspects to all the characters and experiences. i’m sorry, but it was hard to like anything in this book. the homophobia in this book was probably the best part of the book which is weird to say. it was written very well and it really connected the reader with lily. there was real emotion in these scenes (as you would hope lol) and the dialogue was realistic. it was gripping and devastating to say the least! very mad at lo for that… but still it deserves praise. i loved how she let us see the isolation and despair of being lesbian in the 1950s (though it applies to modern times as well). however. this book was only good in the negative parts of the story. it is a bad love story. it’s the type of book straight people read to feel sorry for gay people. i’m sorry but it just doesn’t feel like it was written for sapphic women. like the good part about being queer is being in love! so why not give us a nice love story? why not have some real build up to a relationship and focus a little on the romance of the story? there was nothing romantic about this story. sorry. i know this is a historical novel and not a romance, but really it just seems like a boring sob story. i really tried to like it but i’m a little bit bitter about the homophobia parts lol. it just makes lesbian relationships look all bad and not good, at least in the 1950s. why bother writing about this type of story if you don’t even show the good parts? there ARE good parts of liking the same gender guys.  super immersive, super sapphic, and super well written. this book was so relatable in so many ways and i just loved it. i had nearly no qualms with this book, and finishing it just now i feel like i’ve come up for air from another world. definitely recommend!  4.5 starsPlaylist01. 1950 by King Princess02. Diet Mountain Dew by Lana Del Rey03. Your Best American Girl by Mitski04. Love, My World is Full by RIO05. right where you left me by Taylor SwiftLast Night at the Telegraph Club is far more elegant and well-done than I originally anticipated. Lo provides a thoughtful intersectionality to the predominantly white world of queer literature, and with such a wide and contemplative scope that it really manages to distinguish itself from most other queer YA POC novels I’ve read so far.The story follows Lily Hu: a seventeen-year-old Chinese-American girl born and raised in San Francisco’s Chinatown. With her good grades, compliant personality, and preference to fade into the background and let more dynamic people take the stage, Lily has always been good at being the perfect Chinese-American daughter. And in 1954, at the height of the Red Scare and American paranoia of communist China, there hasn't been a better time to be prim, unnoticed, and obedient.Enter Kath: a quiet, intelligent girl in Lily's math class with dreams of being a pilot. They've been in school together for a long time, but a series of chance encounters leads Lily to look at Kath in a different light. Kath treats Lily's passion for science and disinterest in boys as something completely normal, and as outsider to Lily's traditional world of Chinatown, she allows Lily to explore parts of herself that she's been fervently ignoring.For most of her life, Lily has been quietly and secretly suppressing an unrealized attraction to women. But through her friendship (wink wink) with Kath, Lily allows herself to explore this muted side of herself, eventually culminating in a visit to the Telegraph Club: a lesbian club where Lily is thrown completely out of her depth and into a world of new possibilities.At its core, Last Night at the Telegraph Club is a story of identity, and trying to manage parts of yourself that don't align with each other. The whole coming-of-age is very typical YA, but Lo handles it in a very expert and thoughtful way. By expanding the story beyond Lily's scope and creating some sections that provide perspectives of her close family members, Lo effectively creates a complex story of trying to be an individual and fulfill your own desires while simultaneously trying be a part of your community and maintain your duties. It's far more complex and thoughtful than most YA I'm used to, and honestly, I think I might give some more Malinda Lo books a try.  This is not the usual book I would pick up to read. I read this for a book club and I am happy I did because this book was excellent. The audiobook is really well done. Definitely would recommend.

I really did love it, and there wasn’t anything wrong It just didn’t get to give stars but I rlly loved it! i don’t really know how i feel about this. on one hand, i like how evident the malinda lo’s research was about the gay community and the political context. on the other, i didn’t find anything special about about the plot or characters. it was just another historical fiction. i found the authors notes about her research more interesting than most of the story. perhaps i’m better off watching a history documentary about 1950s america and the asian community, but i do appreciate a different point of view. there is history with numbers and with swathing statements that generalize the experiences of an entire community. then there is history from the eyes of a sapphic chinese american girl working through the implications of her sexuality and culture. i dunno i expected more from the romance and it just didn’t hit for me. another thing was i read this over the span of a month so not exactly the best judge for the flow of the plot. but due to how spaced out my reading periods were, i didn’t get invested into the story. regardless, i enjoyed being exposed to history that’s never even discussed in classrooms. it was a unique experience for me and unlike most other readings, i can say i gained something lasting out of this. so hey 4 stars ————october 15here’s a quote from author malinda lo: ”i especially love that i’m getting to tell a story that has rarely if ever been told: the story of a queer chinese american girl in the 1950s. this girl has been invisible for far too long, but i'm totally certain that she existed, because we always have.”lo also talked about this novel coming from her love for research (*pumps fist in the air* well researched books) causing her to overresearch for a short story. the story was inspired by a nonfiction account called rise of the rocket girls by nathalia holt. it’s a mouthful, but i found it interesting, so i’ll include lo’s own summary of rise of the rocket girls here. ”a nonfiction account of the women who worked at the jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena, california, starting in the late 1940s and early 1950s. these women were computers — they did the mathematical calculations that were necessary to make rockets fly — just like the women in the movie (and book) hidden figures. the jpl women included a chinese american woman named helen ling, who was one of very first asian american women to work in this field. she went on to hire several other asian american women, and i found her story to be really inspiring.lo��s quotes i pasted were found on lo’s blog when she announced the novel in 2017, linked here: https://www.malindalo.com/blog/2017/5...  QUEER ASIAN REP IN HISTORICAL FICTION. I REPEAT. QUEER ASIAN REP IN HISTORICAL FICTION. also see: GIRL WHO WANTS TO MAKE PLANES MEETS GIRL WHO WANTS TO FLY THEM ✈️ (aka the perfect duo)this is honestly one of the most inspiring and impactful books ive ever read! i feel so SEEN in this book and it means so much to me, a queer Chinese-American reader, that this book exists. i loved the way this story shared the east-asian american experience, and even though this was set over half a century ago, i still found myself relating to lily on a deeper level (kinda shows you how well- or NOT well- our society has progressed) first of all, the writing of this book was beautifully done and the author crafted this story so perfectly 💗 it was immersive, captivating, and kept me hooked the whole way through! it is a bit slow-paced at times, but it’s still definitely worth a read. i also think the writing style did a good job of capturing the 1950s environment and the book felt really well researched and informed. as for the romance: lily and kath were SO CUTE. i really enjoyed reading about their interactions, each one of them made me so happy &lt;3 i definitely wanted to give lily a huge hug sometimes though, they all had to go through so much! 😭speaking of their relationship: in the 1950s, as we all know, queer relationships were not acceptable. this book really shows the struggles queer people had to go through back then, like having to keep their sexualities secret, being kicked out by their families, shunned by society, etc. i think this book did a great job of portraying this and it really hit hard for me. watching lily go through these things, as well as the blatant racism she received from the people around her, made the book feel more real and personal. also seeing the dynamic/difference between her and kath, who is a white woman, was very well portrayed. i definitely cried a couple times reading this 🥲overall, READ THIS BOOK. it has queer representation, east-asian representation, women in STEM, it’s historical fiction, and it’s just amazing in general! tw: homophobia, racism  this book is kind of hard to review objectively (lol), but it’s very good. definitely very ya, which sometimes bothered me, because things were explained in a way that make sense to kids, but i don’t think it should’ve been any different. imo it successfully addressed intersectional issues, and i don’t know very much about queer literature &amp; representation but i thought it did a good job.i feel like this review is very incomplete without how it made me feel personally, but maybe i’ll update that in the future once i’m a little more sure of my own identity. give me a few years or something,,,   «Haven't you ever wondered what it would be like to have nothing keeping you attached to the ground?»Lily Hu tem dezassete anos e é americana de ascendência chinesa. Estamos em plena Guerra Fria, em 1954, uma altura particularmente perigosa para pessoas como ela nos Estados Unidos, com o medo do comunismo a ditar o comportamento em sociedade. Como se isso não bastasse, Lily não consegue negar a atração que sente pela colega Kathleen Miller, que contraria tudo o que supostamente seria natural num relacionamento romântico, mas a ela lhe parece o mais puro dos sentimentos. O Telegraph Club surge então como meio de afirmação e descoberta para Lily e para mulheres como ela, numa altura em que a palavra lésbica é ainda sussurrada.Este é o tipo de livro que não se esquece facilmente. Com uma escrita que nos coloca no centro da história e nos transporta aos anos 50, Malinda Lo consegue captar a nossa atenção desde o início. O começo da história, apesar de um pouco lento, dá-nos logo um vislumbre daquilo que podemos esperar com o passar das páginas. As personagens que aqui encontramos são extremamente reais, fáceis de amar e odiar, mas sobretudo de compreender. A rebeldia e a ousadia demonstradas, essencialmente pela protagonista mas não só, numa tentativa de viver a vida que se quer e não a que foi desenhada para se viver estão na essência desta história. O contexto social e político é explorado na medida certa, levando-nos a conhecer um pouco da história da emigração chinesa para os EUA, da comunidade homossexual em São Francisco nos anos 50 e da forma como as políticas foram influenciando milhares de vidas ao longo do tempo. Uma leitura maravilhosa que recomendo a todos, particularmente fãs de romance YA e ficção histórica.  LAST NIGHT AT THE TELEGRAPH CLUB by Malinda Lo is in my Top 5 of 2021 so far and shockingly in one of my least favorite genres: historical fiction. The time period is so well written-- I felt so immersed. From the first sentence to the historical notes, it's obvious the love and care Malindo Lo put into telling a story that deserves to be read. I sobbed in the last few chapters, not just for the emotional storytelling, but for the queer futures written into existence. It's so beautiful to behold that a life for Lily and Kath, and new generations of lesbians, would become more attainable and with less social barriers It is possible to have a future and to be loved and seen. There are definitely still struggles in the queer community, especially for people of color in the LGBTQIA+ community. Laws still exist that threaten the livelihood and well-being of the LGBTQIA+ community. But there is also less stigma and more people openly fighting against homophobia. Idk, I just loved the author's process for unearthening a story that has been erased, bringing it to life through fiction, and sharing with contemporary teens, especially Chinese-American lesbians, "Hey, you have existed and you will continue to exist," and that's fucking beautiful.  ****3.5***I picked up this book because 1) The Title was catchy.2) The Cover was amazing.3) This book fits for one of my yearly challenge.Lily Hu is a American-Chinese girl in 1950’s living in San Francisco Chinatown. A very turbulent time for Chinese people in America as American government suspecting every Chinese to be a Communist. Lily is a very ambitious girl with a good head on her neck. She is studious and not interested in boys, marriage or kids. Lily has a dream of working for space. Soon Lily is drawn to another girl Kath in school who shares similar interests as herself. And romance blooms between them which is all new to Lily. Kath introduces Lily to Telegraph club, a bar where people like them can be themselves while world outside is not at all friendly towards the homosexuals. The story twists and turns after a raid at the Telegraph Club and Lily’s life turns upside down.A very well researched book but the thing that fascinated me was effortless writing. I was into the story from the first line. Just slipped in. I liked the characters but I feel Kath’s character was a bit dreamlike, nothing concrete, just floating kind. I would have liked more of Kath and her emotions. The plot was slow almost till 70% of the book nothing major happens. And after 70% there is a massive overflow of emotions, drama etc. It was a very enjoyable read if I overlook the slow paced execution. A really easy to get in romance story. Happy Reading!!  LAST NIGHT AT THE TELEGRAPH CLUB by Malinda Lo is set in 1950’s San Francisco Chinatown, and is centered around seventeen year old Chinese American Lily Hu. Lily has always felt a little different than other girls with her love for math and science, but she starts to worry when she develops feelings for her classmate Kathleen in a time when it is dangerous to be queer. With concerns about Communism and risk of deportation making their way through their Chinatown community, Lily is urged by her parents not to create waves during this fragile time. Does she follow her heart, or try to stifle her feelings and blend in with the crowd?I love the writing in this book, and the representation that is hardly featured in historical fiction (queer and Asian). I really loved Lily, and was rooting for her from the very first chapter of the novel. Lo writes Lily’s emotions so well, and I really felt her exploring her queerness, and weighing what that meant for the time period she’s living in.Ultimately this book is about love. Love for friends, romantic interests, family, and even places (I would argue that this book is a love letter to the city of San Francisco, and it made me long for the city). Emily X.R. Pan’s front cover blurb nails it on the head, “This book is for anyone who has ever loved — in any sense of the word.”Highly recommend for fans of love stories, or those looking for more representation in their historical fiction novels.   4.5I believe this book is a perfect example of young adult literary fiction. It uses the literary fiction style of framing the story from the protagonist (in this case lily)’s mental state of the moment, and using lots of little details to describe settings. As someone who much prefers adult books I loved that this writing felt like an adult book, just without the (for lack of a better word) vulgar content. I highly recommend this book if you’re looking to enter the literary fiction genre. I loved the way this book handled homosexuality it the 1950s. It very bluntly showed the harsh reality of the prejudices of the time, while also showing the happiness of young love and queer communities. The ending was a perfect bittersweet balance of happiness and realism of queer relationships during that time period. While I believe anyone can and will enjoy this book, as a queer person, I particularly appreciated seeing bits of queer history that I knew about and learning things I didn’t. Lastly, as a white person, I can’t speak to the quality of the Asian representation, but from what I have heard from Asian people, this book does a really good job with it’s portrayal of anti-Asian racism. Malinda Lo is definitely an author I will be reading more from.  It's only April so who knows what else I'll read, but I'm sure this will be one of my best of the year. Still too in my feelings for coherent thoughts??? For basic concept reasons, it's not surprising that I enjoyed this: historical fiction with a nonwhite queer teen!! But it was also so well executed. I both loved and was gutted by Lily's coming of age journey as she navigated so many spaces that did not want to be her whole and complete self. In spite of all of that: there is a love and a warmth to this book. There is trauma in abundance here, but it's also not about that. It's a coming of age story and so Lily does find her way, amidst the homophobia of her home life, and the racism of well, everywhere, but including her newfound queer spaces. Unsurprisingly, I cried a lot (and there were moments where Lily is trying to understand her own identity where I truly cannot tell you whether I was crying for Lily or my own teenage self, but OOF). I listened to this as an audiobook (which was well narrated!) but I am going to buy a physical copy of this book and maybe even read it again before the year is up so I can cry on some pages I own -- you know, for funsies.  I could not have loved this book any more. It’s set in 1954 in San Fransisco. Lily, a Chinese American high school senior, comes to terms with owning her sexuality. She befriends Kath, a fellow classmate who shares her love of math and all things science. They soon learn they have even more in common, including an interest in The Telegraph Club, a lesbian bar.This book was the most beautiful depiction of young love, coupled with the endless journey of understanding yourself. And not just understanding yourself, but defending who you are with all that you have.My favorite part of this book was the community surrounding The Telegraph Club. I can’t imagine the immense relief of finding a place you can truly be yourself in a world that constantly condemns you for just that. The found family at this bar was so special to me and I’ll be thinking of the patrons for a long while. The ending was just as it should have been, or just as it could have been, with a book about two women falling in love in the 1950s. I don’t want to give too much away here, but I just appreciated the ending so much. This is a must read!   “she began to feel as if she had been split in two, and only one half of her was in this living room. that was the good chinese daughter who was delicately chewing her way around the bones in each piece of hsün yü ... the other half had been left out on the sidewalk before lily walked in the front door. that was the girl who spent last night in the north beach apartment of a caucasian woman she barely knew ... perhaps one day she’d get used to the way it made her feel: dislocated and dazed, never quite certain if the other half of her would stay offstage as directed.”“she wondered where kath was. she wondered if kath could sense her, sitting here on this train as it took her away. perhaps it was possible, if she closed her eyes and sent out her thoughts along the steel track like a message along a telegraph wire. i love you. i love you.the train swayed gently beneath her, and she leaned against the window to feel the cool glass against her cheek, and she was sure that kath had heard her, she was sure.”UM WOW??? i feel so seen by this book ETA - Reread this for my LGBTQ+ book discussion and oh my, it is so masterful. I'm eager to talk about the idea of indoctrination as it relates to people's perception of queer culture and the Communism scare of the 1950s and what is happening in state politics today. This book hit me right in the middle of a terrible reading slump, so it taking me forever to read is NO reflection on the amazingness of this book. This superbly researched historical novel looks at life as a questioning/gay Chinese-American teen in the 1950s. When Lily spies a newspaper ad with a photo of female impersonator Tommy Andrews, she's enchanted. New friend Kath has also heard of Tommy Andrews and has been to the Telegraph Club to see the performer and offers to take Lily. That visit and Lily's blossoming feelings for Kath change her life. But these are changes that Lily has to keep hidden from her family and her friends at school. Not a romance, but a powerful story of first love in a society that won't accept them as they are.  Absolutely phenomenal! I can't believe this got published as a teen book, but I'm so glad it did, kids need to read this stuff!"Last Night at the Telegraph Club" is historical queer YA fiction. It follows Lilly, her family, her friends, and the new world she discovers. The queer scene is very physically close in 1950s SF to Chinatown, where her and her family live, but it may as well be worlds away.This book is a coming of age, a book about self discovery, how one balances multiple identities. It's also somewhat of a romance, with a few super super super romantic scenes!I'd like to say more, but I want you to experience the story for yourself! Just know, if you are looking for a YA lesbian historical fiction taking place post WWII and pre Stonewall, in SF, featuring references to lesbian pulp fiction, strong women, and gender performance, this is it.You know you can't wait to read this book!!! STRONGLY recommended!!!  Today I spent most of the afternoon fixed to this spot, where I read over the entire second half of *Last Night at the Telegraph Club*. I was entirely engrossed in the story of Lily, her budding attraction to Kathleen (Kath) and their secret trips to a lesbian bar named the Telegraph in San Francisco during the mid 1950s.The novel, written for young adults but just as rich for adults, is part historical fiction, part love story, and part queer coming-of-age. What it does so well and best of all is its descriptions of Lily's emotions---both of first (and secret) love and her growing understanding of who she is---and how that understanding forces her to develop. The troubled yearnings of Lily and Kath will stay with me a long time, I know, for its depth, sweetness, and nuance.The scene depicted on the book's cover, among a few others, was just unforgettable. The ending felt a tad rushed, but the epilogue made up for it!  3.5 stars i really wanted to like this book but unfortunately i just found it boring for most of it. it felt like there were two separate plots that were both underdeveloped, one surrounding her chinese identity and the other her gay identity. i wish they were more intertwined. there were many scenes that felt superfluous or didn’t add enough to the overall story to keep me engaged. i will say that there were cute parts, and i enjoyed the representation. it was an important and well researched story. i just think it could’ve been executed better. 3.5 stars for the idea and the cute parts.  I... need to collect my thoughts. There is so much in here that made me go through an entire spectrum of emotions. I'll be swooning and crying over sapphic feelings one chapter, then feeling like throwing up in the next from all the gaslighting by friends/family because; "A homosexual teenage girl? In a good, virtuous Chinese family? She must be sick in the head."On top of all that, there is the at times horrible climate that Asian Americans live in during that era (1930s to 1950s).This is such an important and fascinating read, especially because the author put in so much effort into researching every topic she explored in the story, complete with a full bibliography at the end of the book and the names of people she has interviewed. Even with all the heavy topics however, Malinda's writing is gorgeous and engaging. I could not put it down even with all the emotions wreaking havoc.  4 stars. Really enjoyed this but man did it break my heart in the end. Sure, the ending is supposed to be an HEA but it left me feeling a bit melancholy. Kath and Lily have such a sweet and quiet kind of romance that it was easy to root for them but it always left me on edge of them getting exposed or caught somehow. They deserved to be happy. I really enjoyed them both as characters and I especially thought Lily went through some great development throughout. The writing is excellent. This was my first book by Lo and I was floored by the gorgeous writing and the way she described places. The pacing is great, the book never felt slow going or dull for me. This was the perfect read for today as it’s snowing outside and this book was very cozy and full of heart. I really did enjoy it and everything that it stands for. I would definitely recommend it. It’s a lovely read.   Wow. Although the book began pretty slowly, the last ten chapters had no right making me cry as much as they did. As a closeted queer Asian kid who isn’t much younger than Lily Hu, ‘Last Night at the Telegraph Club’ hit a little too close to home with the coming-of-age and spring awakening of a Chinese-American living in San Francisco - it had delicious food descriptions that had me drooling, growing up in a traditional Asian-American community who most likely won’t accept your identity, and dreaming of a brighter future. Like Sunny said, the only slight issue I have is that Kath and Lily reunited too soon and it felt somewhat anticlimactic. More penitence, more pining, more essential angst during the years between, perhaps, if they were to meet again at the end of their college years or as adults. But, uh, other than that? GO READ THIS NOVEL YOU LITTLE BITCHES.  Primera leída: Este libro fue tan hermoso. El estilo de escritura, los personajes, todo fue tan precioso y bien construido. Mi único problema fue el final, no sentí que la historia llegara a un cierre satisfactorio y fue una lástima porque en serio tenía potencial para tener 5 estrellas. Igualmente se convirtió en uno de mis libros favoritos de toda la vida y estoy segura de que lo voy a volver a leer muy pronto.Segunda leída: Me sigue gustando mucho, la manera de escribir de Malinda Lo es ARTE, el final esta vez me convenció más pero simplemente hay algo que no estoy segura de qué es que no me cierra pero decidiré ponerle 5 estrellas porque ya superé lo del final y me di cuenta de que de hecho es perfecto.  I read this as a buddy read with syna, though it’s been on my list for a while and my GOODNESS!! It was honestly magnificent I genuinely adored it so much and the writing was dazzling, absolutely going to read more from this author. The only reason I’m not giving this 5 stars is because of the pain I felt while reading it, though that’s a more personal issue with the book. The queer pain and suffering just reached up from the pages and grabbed me and I UGH it was so so so good but my heart twisted horribly when reading it but I’m not sure I would have it any other waySide note: there was a major side plot that never got resolved?? Like?? The communists?? What is going on UPDATE I GAVE IT FIVE STARS   Content warnings: racism, lesbophobia, outing, police Rep: Lily (main character) is Chinese-American and lesbian, Kath (love interest) is a white butch lesbian. Lily's family and friends are all Chinese-American, and her school peers are all white.This book was phenomenally written. It's gorgeous, it's powerful, and made me cry.I talk about books at these places: Instagram / Twitter / TikTok / Blog  What was it like to be lesbian in 1050s? This is a warm and at the same time, tense story of a first love and rebellion. I like Lilly and I love seeing her learn her way around this new world. Kath is definitely a bright influence on Lily's life. This book makes me sad to think of how many people were forced to hide themselves just to have somewhat normal lives. The beginning was very slow-paced and hard to get into. There was even a point where I thought I would DNF this book. That is why I subtracted one star from my rating.   This may be due to the reading slump I’m in, but this just felt so long and laborious. I’m really surprised as it was one of my most anticipated 2021 releases, but I just didn’t find it engaging. I didn’t feel anything throughout the book and it just felt like it was drawn out for the sake of it. I really loved the concept and I think it discussed important themes, but it just felt so difficult to get through.   This is a hard book to review. When it comes to reading pleasure it was more of a 3.5 for me. Malinda Lo has a certain writing style that I loved years ago but find harder to enjoy nowadays. It's a very slow, more telling than showing style. However, it's obvious how much research and love went into this story. So, I'm happy to round my rating up to 4. I learned a lot, which is always a nice side effect.  America, the 1950s. This book tells Lily’s story as she comes to terms with the fact that she likes women, and falls in love for the first time. There is a clear, accurate timeline reminding us of the historical background and heavy issues of the time : racism, homophobia, the paranoia and fear surrounding communism…For those saying they were born in the wrong generation, this is a reminder of how things really were for those who were «&nbsp;different&nbsp;».  This was astonishingly beautiful. Holy shit. I loved everything about this. It was a stunning love story that needed to be told. We NEED more stories like Lily and Kath’s. Not just a modern story, but a period piece that shows this isn’t new. Love of all kinds is not new. It was perfection. And had one of THE hottest sex scenes. I said what I said.  dnf @ 32%i wasn’t the biggest fan of the author’s writing style, and the flashbacks every few chapters kept taking me out of the book. i also didn’t care for any of the characters or the plot in general. i have heard very good things about this book though, so maybe it just wasn’t for me. so definitely don’t let me keep you from reading this if it sounds like something you’d like :))  This was a 3.75 star for me, I think this history is not very well known. It occasionally felt quite on the nose for me, and did some telling and not showing. The authors note was fascinating. I think the only reason it was less than a 4 is because I’m very much pulling away from YA right now. I would 100% recommend this book to young adults!!!  A coming of age drama that takes place in the 1950s about a Chinese-American family, but mostly the oldest daughter who is determining that her sexuality is not what most would expect - especially her parents. Well-written, kept my interest throughout. Trigger Warnings: Racism, racial slurs, sexism, prejudice, homophobia, internalized homophobia, stripping of citizenship, discussion of war and politics, sexual activity, miscarriage, arrests, child abuse, smoking, underage drinking, xenophobia, mention of deportation One star is harsh, but i didn’t finish the book. the pace was just way too slow for me and not enough going on with the story line to keep me interested. i think she’s a great author, but not my cup of tea. glad i gave this book a try!  3.5 stars I think there would be some things I would change but I loved the characters.some things I didn't like is that I think I wasn't in the right mood for a like a 1900s environment but I still loved it and I didn't like the flashbacks idk really bored me... I'm glad I read it tho!!  Review to come  This was so so good video review! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F0vM... Absolutely beautiful. I would like more books like this please. the yearning  So beautiful and wonderfully researched and just magical. My heart is aching.  1950’s san francisco lesbians? it’s a yes from me.  I deeply hated it but I don’t wanna give it 1 star because the representation was really good!!It took me so long to read because I was super bored and didn’t want to even continue it 😶‍🌫️ AMAZING. SIMPLY WONDERFUL. I love this and I am not okay DNF 35%. The characters are a bore and there is no plot.  I just really fucking love Malinda Lo's writing. It's so gorgeous and sucks me into the story. I can see how this wouldn't appeal to everyone, but I absolutely loved it.  So many mixed emotions. It was so beautifully written. I'm absolutely crazy about the book now.  ta płakałam i co, a tak serio to bardzo wartościowa i niezwykle samoswiadoma ksiakza ❤️ chyba dawno żadna powieść ya tak mi się nie podobała, bardzo dobra reprezentacja, ciekawe wydarzenia, świetnie sportretowane okoliczności i przeżycia i emocje bohaterki, polecam!! "Perhaps it was possible, if she closed her eyes and sent out her thoughts along the steel track like a message along a telegraph wire. I love you. I love you. The train swayed gently beneath her, and she leaned against the window to feel the cool glass against her cheek, and she was sure that Kath had heard her, she was sure.”I cannot begin to express how beautiful and impactful Last Night at the Telegraph Club is. It is truly a story of the voices in history we don't hear, but with the added brilliance of fiction and the intensity of a beautiful romance.Lily was such an honest character. Every single emotion she felt, I felt radiating off her. Every moment of confusion, of understanding, of fear, of love. It was all there, as authentic as a character — as any person can be. Lily had a coming of age, but she also had a coming of understanding that brought me along with her to see that this world is meant to have its limits tested; that the people on this world may not be accepting, but that doesn't mean anything she or anyone else who is deemed wrong actually is. It probably means the opposite."She felt as if her mind had been turned off, and all this was happening to someone who looked like her but couldn't possibly be her.”This is a moment I’ve never quite been able to describe myself, but it’s so telling of the most important and often heartbreaking moments of our life. I can distinctly recall three moments of my life where this has been exactly what I was going through. Quotes like this and books about people like Lily and Kath make me feel like I’m not alone. That the things I feel maybe aren’t universal, but that they also aren’t things I go through on my own.As you can probably tell, Malinda Lo's writing itself is captivating. I didn't fly through it, in part because I simply haven't had the time or energy lately, but also mostly because I wanted to savor this book. This is a book that is meant to be digested, chapter by chapter, page by page, word by word.The lesbian representation especially meant the world to me. I think this was my first time reading sapphic historical fiction and oh my GOD, what a book to start out with.If you're looking for Asian-American reviewers, I suggest reading my friend Micah's review! Her username is @canonicallychaotic :))Last Night at the Telegraph Club is a book about a past that needs to be told, but it’s also one that opens so many avenues for the future. I feel like I barely even scratched the surface of what the book really means to me, and obviously to thousands of other readers, but hopefully this was enough to convince you that this book is one you’ll need to pick up soon.  I was not fully prepared for the pain that this book brought me. This book encompasses the beautiful feeling of falling in love, but also the heartbreak of falling in love in the wrong era. Lily and Kath navigate their relationship and their true identities in 1950s San Francisco, with obstacles constantly being thrown their way. "She missed Kath. She missed having Kath to talk to, yes, but she also missed having Kath listen to her. Rockets to the moon didn't seem so far-fetched when Kath listened to her. She made previously unimaginable things seem possible." The sweet and tender relationship between Lily and Kath was a pleasure to read. I really enjoyed reading Lily’s perspective. She managed to entertain and hook me through her navigating high school, her family, and, most importantly, her sexuality during trying times "She felt the rub of her mother's wedding ring against her skin, and her mother's face swam into focus, her brown eyes full of the sharp worry of love, and Lily thought, You will never look at me like this again."This book brought me such giddy joy and then managed to break my heart over and over. One thing that I particularly struggled with was trying to determine my feelings for the characters. Of course, I adore Lily and Kath, but the others, such as Lily’s family and friends, were more complex. Most of them weren’t there and supportive of Lily, which I can’t forgive, but they had their moments and I have to remember that this was the 1950s. "She felt Kath's hand letting go of hers again and again; her fingers sliding through hers over and over. Everything she and Kath had done could be erased so easily. It could be erased by her family pretending it had never happened. It could be erased by her parents uprooting her from her home and sending her away so that Kath would not know where she was. It could be erased because they were her parents and she was their daughter, and they loved her, and she could not disobey them even if it broke her heart."It was naïve of me to let myself hope that this would have a perfect, happy ending. Lily coming out to her mother was the most emotionally charged scene in this whole book. I cried. A lot. It broke me more and more to see the lack of support Lily got from her parents, aunt, and Shirley. The thought that my mother, who is and always has been my best friend, wouldn’t support me because of my sexuality is something that I can’t even comprehend and imagine. I don’t like to think about that but I know it’s a very real possibility for myself and for others, and that hurts. Props to Malinda Lo for writing a compelling story that highlights a period in time that wasn’t easy for queer teens and Chinese-Americans, and I just want to take a moment to appreciate all the research and thought that went into this book.  This book is my new best friend.Oh my God, I loved this so much. SO MUCH. I was going to say this is one of the best YA books I’ve ever read, but to be honest, I think part of that is because it doesn’t feel like a young adult book most of the time. Plenty of books aimed at an adult audience have teenage protagonists, and that’s what this one felt like. I think this would be a great crossover book for older readers who think that YA is too young for them.The author did a phenomenal job here with every aspect—the setting, the characterization, the political and social situations, the family dynamics, the inner turmoil of our main character Lily. She just nailed all of it. I will say, the one thing I felt that wasn’t totally positive isn’t even on the book at all and in fact speaks very highly of the writing: the setting was done so perfectly that it made me so incredibly nostalgic for my life in San Francisco, made me miss living there so much, that it honestly made me tear up a couple of times. I mean, I also teared up over the actual story a few times, too, but there was some mistiness over reading about streets I used to walk down, places I used to pass, sights I used to know by heart. Sigh. It was so evocative and just got me good.I also am in awe of how well Lo worked in all of the historical information without it ever feeling clunky or heavy-handed at all. We learn about the plight of Chinese Americans during the Red Scare, life in Chinatown in the 1950s, queer life, and so much more. It’s folded in so seamlessly and you end up learning a lot without ever feeling like you were suddenly reading a nonfiction book, as can happen sometimes with historical fiction. Lo also has extensive notes at the back with more detailed information on the political and social issues present in the novel. I adored Lily and felt so much for her. Being a queer white woman born in 1980, I can only begin to imagine what it must have been like for any queer person coming to terms with their identity in the 1950s, let alone a Chinese girl with the weight of family expectations, societal rules, and the threat that your true self could put others at risk if found out. Her arc through the novel is beautiful to witness, even if she struggled through some scary and dark moments along the way. I also loved meeting all of the amazing queer babes at the Telegraph Club!The ending was done expertly too, in my opinion. Things aren’t neatly tied up with a bow, but we’re given just enough closure and hope to make it satisfying. I just adored everything about this book. I didn’t want it to end, to be honest. Love love love. It made my gay little heart so happy.  This is a very slow and gentle coming-of-age story about Lily, a second-gen Chinese-American girl discovering her queerness, her relationship to gender, her ambition and how all those discoveries affect her friendships as forged within the community. Think 1950s San Francisco high-school tale, but very slow-burn because of all the danger of being found out by the cops or your family (the other cops). The non-linear storytelling takes us back every now and then to Lily's parents meeting, gives us a glimpse into her paternal aunt Judy, as they inhabit an America rife with 1930-50s panic about Asians: Japanese, Korean, Chinese. Shifting back and forth explains the context Lily inhabits in her present well, where she hopes to be a Chinese-American girl in STEM. We experience two generations' racism, invisibility, threat of deportation, ambition, journeys of love so we can have a plurality of Asian-American experiences within one family and understand the stratification within Chinatown itself (where the white-collar professionals go, where the service workers go, etc.). Lily is the thread binding all of this together, on her own gender-atypical trajectory. The language is sweet, simple, soft, the story unfolding with very teenage hesitation. This is an exercise in longing and hope where the words and images are plain but loving. It's so steeped in its San Francisco and Chinatown imagery and setting - just filled with references - that it's basically a creative historical reimagining of what it might have been like back then as an Asian queer girl (the author says as much in the notes towards the end; she was wondering what being an Asian woman in those rooms would have been like because those figures were few and far in between in the archives). I liked the story for how informational it was about how queerness has changed over time.It's much more character-focused than plot (which is honestly very predictable so you have to be invested in the people populating the story), with the most interesting being the queer community Lily finds. It took me back to all the confusion, tumult, rush, longing of being a queer kid in school, all the ways our non-queer friends can be selfish and fail us. Being minority friends bonding over marginalization works so well until it doesn't, until you're just a little too marginalized for your friend, because you don't have anything in common as people -- only as demographics.  rating: 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000/5i am so glad i read this book at night so my parents couldn't see me bawling my eyes out. i cannot express how beautiful this book was to read. it was epiphanic, gorgeous, and magical.set in the 1950s, our main character, a chinese-born american, experiences accurately the passive-aggressiveness towards orientals at that time. you don't get people killing them, just people asking "oh, you know english?", "can you explain to me about this japanese sculpture", and most importantly, their perceptions and impact of communism during this cold war period.i like how our main character loses her parents and friends because she is queer and there is no reconciliation between them. queer stories tend to have this sort of sad reunion where they apologise for ever holding that against them, but this it is exactly what i, and loads of queers from prejudiced poc families have experienced.i absolutely enjoyed the slow burn, and i am glad the author set up some chemistry between kath and lily first before revealing that they were both queer. and i am even more amazed with the whole butch and femme distinction without pushing gender role agenda onto either of them.this might just have been the best book i have read so far this year.looking at the other reviews on goodreads for this book, it is quite clear that this book has met its mark and striked its chord with majority of the reviewers, honestly rare for authors, and quite specifically for malinda lo (if you look at her other books, they are all good ratings, but none as high as this book). the common criticism for this book has been her writing and unnecessary of flashback scenes, and i am inclined to agree that three or four of those flashback scenes should have been cut since it didn't add anything to the story.this ode to a lesbian chinese-american coming to terms with herself and her sexuality in the setting of brutal cold war america was epiphanic, and a rare sight to behold in the book community. it does not capitalise on any sort of trauma, but only aims to stay true to the experiences. it is clear that the author has done extensive research on these facets of the matter, and i think this should be the standard for queer poc historical fiction.if you haven't already got the point, I FREAKING LOVE THIS BOOK!!!TW: the author wrote it in her author's note in the book, but i thought i should emphasise here, because she was going for historically accurate, words such as orientals, negroes, and dyke was used, though not derogatorily. if these words trigger you, it might be best not to read it.  4,00TW da sapere prima di approcciarsi a questa lettura: omofobia (da moderata a severa), razzismo (da moderato a severo), abuso di potere da parte della polizia (moderato) e famiglia omofoba.Questa libro narra la storia di una ragazza nel processo di scoprire la propria sessualità nella Chinatown di San Francisco negli anni '50 e il suo primo amore. Questo scoperta sé risulta inizialmente molto lenta, ed accompagnata da un senso vergogna dovuto probabilmente a dell'omofobia interiorizzata e un senso di colpa dovuto alle aspettative altrui. Per via di questa lentezza inizialmente l'opera non mi aveva particolarmente colpito, ma con il proseguire della narrazione l'opera a cominciato a piacermi notevolmente di più, soprattutto a causa della protagonista e del suo modo di raccontare la storia, soprattutto internamente.Inoltre, le scene in cui è presente il suo interesse amoroso, e il suo rapporto con lei, sono molto carine da leggere.Per quanto riguarda  la scena in cui Lily si confronta con sua madre riguardo la propria sessualità, la risposta di lei e gli eventi che ne seguono  l'ho trovata estremamente triste, ma molto verosimile, soprattutto per il periodo storico in cui è stato ambientato il libro.Per quanto riguarda un giudizio più generale sulla veridicità storica non mi posso esprimere, sia per mancata conoscenza del periodo in generale, ma soprattutto per quanto riguarda quel periodo in America. Ciò è dovuto a un mancato interesse nel periodo, che ha purtroppo, anche se marginalmente, influito negativamente sul mio apprezzamento dell'opera.  2.5/5 stars rounded down to 2/5 stars---i was SO excited to read this book. i mean, gay bar lesbian high school romance and the COVER?! who could turn this down?however, i was disappointed.everything about this book was average (at best). my main issue was the characters. they were just so bland and generic. from the main character (lily) to the love interest (kath) the characters were underdeveloped and so generic. kath seemed like the most basic lesbian love interest that the author could have possibly written. i mean, i think we know more about her friend jean than we do about kath. her entire personality is liking planes and that's pretty much it. i think all of the side characters were honestly much more developed than the main ones (ie; shirley or lana had more of a personality than lily and kath combined) additionally, their relationship was just so average and felt very tense and almost forced. i really couldn't get attached to the characters or their relationship.now, this book wasn't terrible. however. i will NEVER forgive malinda lo for the gap between the story and the epilogue. the fact that the main story ended so abruptly with kath being sent away, and then the epilogue just picks right back up after both lily and kath have made their own lives living separately for a while is just so confusing, unnecessary, and frankly, annoying.  the end of the story was really where it picked up, and then cutting it off like that and reconvening in a completely useless part of the story is not it.an interesting thing that malinda lo also did was switch between the main story and then some flashbacks from lily's mother and aunt's point of view. while this was kind of interesting, it really didn't contribute to the story, and, in my opinion, kind of felt like filler space that she could have filled with the time that she completely cut out before the epilogue.i will say, it was interesting the way that the author included some of the societal and political situations in san fransisco during that time, and the author's note was honestly more interesting than the story.---bottom line:- it was a slow read that did keep me hooked, so i don't really regret reading it, i just expected much, much more.- most of these booktok books are very average, and many of them have below-average writing.  Last night at the Telegraph Club es una historia coming-of-age muy bonita a la par que dura.La historia nos transporta a Chinatown (San Francisco, EEUU) en los años 50, durante la Guerra Fría. A través de sus páginas vemos no solo la situación de las personas LGBT por aquel entonces, sino también los temas de la inmigración, el racismo, las deportaciones, las cazas de brujas a acusados por comunistas, etc. Y este yo creo que es el punto más fuerte de la historia: la documentación que hay sobre la época y la ambientación, que son increíbles.Además, está contada desde una perspectiva asiática-americana queer, la de Lily, la protagonista. Ella es una chica que se encuentra en el último año de instituto y, a pesar de haber nacido en América, toda su familia es de China por lo que ella frecuentemente se encuentra entre estas dos culturas. Lily me ha encantado como protagonista. Es una chica muy inocente que a lo largo de la novela crece muchísimo y la evolución que hay en ella es brutal.Quizás lo que más me ha fallado de este libro es que se venda como una historia romántica sáfica. Sí, el romance a estado bien, pero muchas veces queda en segundo plano. De hecho, me atrevería a decir que el eje central de toda la historia es el autodescubrimiento de Lily y los dilemas de ser una persona entre dos mundos tan distintos. Además, se ha tratado el tema de las amistades tóxicas. Algo que en la adolescencia es muy necesario enseñar ya que es fácil juntarte con gente que no es buena para ti.  mysle ze 4.5 ale mam problem z ocenianiem ksiazek ostatnio wiec zawyze zeby nie bylo!! SPOILER bo wiem ze czesc z was bedzie czytac widzowiea wiec tak, sadzilam ze bedzie troche wiecej wspomnianie o komunizmie, mimo ze to nie byl glowny temat tej ksiazki to jakos przez sam opis spodziewalam sie tego, chociaz po namysle jednak mozna powiedziec, ze troche tego watku bylo, ale troche stracil potencjal imosadzilam tez przez pryzmat opisu ze dziewczyny beda serio pokazywaly ta milosc swiatu, a jednak totalnie sie tak nie dzialo - ale mozna tez spojrzec na to z innej strony i wtedy jednak mozna zgodzic sie z tym stwierdzeniempostac lily pozostawiala mnie czasami confused, ciezko mi bylo sobie ja wyobrazic bo jej charakter strasznie sie ze soba klocil czasami, ale moze to po prostu najbardziej realistyczna postac?zakonczenie? that was INSANE i jak z jednej strony czulam sie troche "oszukana" [chociazby patrz akapit nr 2] tak no nie wiem, moze tak to po prostu wtedy wygladalo, wszystko dzialo sie szybko (nie przeszkadzalo mi to o dziwo) i brak emocji ze strony lily chociazby po tym jak musiala opuscic dom??? i to, ze wspominala tylko o kath - understandable but still, nic wiecej i moze milosc to robi z ludzmi, ale nadal wydaje mi sie to jakos nierzeczywiste.wsm epilog spoko, dobrze bylo je widziec juz over the whole thunderstorm i chyba bym nie przezyla otwartego zakonczenia (wsm to jest otwarte zakonczenie i kluje mnie w sercu przez to ale da sie przezyc.)moze tak nie jest, ale wydaje mi sie, ze wiele sytuacji jest metafora do chociazby samego homoseksualizmu i poznawania siebie przez bohaterke i jest to tak fajnie ubrane w slowa ze doalownie jestem obsessed i nie wierze, ze niektore sytuacje wydarzyly sie po prostu o takthats all i really enjoyed [im gonna be heartbroken for next few weeks] 😁😁 This book has it all! A queer young adult, historical romance featuring an Asian-American teenager! I don't read much YA anymore, but this is exactly the type of book that keeps me reading the genre. It's a story that's just as impactful for adults as it is for teenagers and covers a really interesting part of American history that I didn't really know very much about. I've read a few books on Japanese internment camps and anti-Japanese sentiments during and after WWII, but I haven't read very much about the red-scare, which was about anti-Chinese sentiments during the rise of communism post WWII.Last Night at the Telegraph Club isn't really about the red scare, but it does greatly influence the setting of the story. The book centers around 17 year old Lily Hu, a science and space loving teenager working hard to finish school and get into a good university so that she can continue to study science. At the same time, Lily is questioning her burgeoning sexuality when she meets Kath Miller and they discover a common interest in the Telegraph Club, a bar featuring a male impersonator that is heavily frequented by women. It's the 1950's, so there's never a good time to be gay, and Lily's worries are further exacerbated by the threat of deportation that hangs over every Chinese family due to the paranoia about communism.I loved the writing in this book and found Lily to be an extremely relatable character. She just wants to be a "good girl" in the eyes of her parents, teachers, and friends, but their view of what is "good" is so narrow and when her friends start dating boys, she is also understandably curious about Kath and the Telegraph Club. She is very nervous and suffers from so much doubt - I felt like I was right there with her. Whether you're queer or not, I feel like any teenager can relate to Lily's insecurity as she explores her sexuality and the world suddenly opens up into this even bigger and scarier place. Add in all of the familial and cultural expectations that she also had to contend with, I really empathized with her. What I think makes this book so unique is that there was no easy solution for Lily. It's 1954, it's not like it's going to suddenly be okay for her to be gay or that she could expect her sexual orientation to be accepted by either her friends or family. There's a lot of homophobia in the book, which was accurate to the time period. It was heartbreaking to me that all the lesbians in the book pretty much had to come to terms with separating from their friends and family to be with the person they loved. It was impossible to expect that things would turn out well for Lily given the time period and setting, so I really liked how the author chose to end the book as well. It's hopeful, yet realistic. Definitely recommend this book to everyone!   Malinda Lo’s impeccable prose and seemingly effortless plotting makes this beautiful book so much more than a YA lesbian love story has any right to be. Wow.Dealing with family, community loyalty and the fickleness of teenage friendships as well as discovering sexuality, the engaging originality comes from the framing through the Chinese-American perspective and perfect evocation of San Francisco in the mid 1950s. Every element of the story is in perfect balance and nothing feels too much; you want to know more about everything. More about the difficulty of being Chinese in the US under McCarthy, more about being an unconventionally ambitious young woman and wanting to be a scientist, more about the lesbian community in San Francisco, more about the Chinese community in San Francisco. Lily is the perfect character to convey and display all of this emotional and cultural complexity. The flashbacks into her family’s recent history are perfectly places and pitched to help a modern reader understand the trauma of post-war experience in both China and the US. The instances of PTSD are well handled, and included with good reason to expand on the resilience of migrant communities and the motivations of the adults in Lily’s life.  *3.5while i think this was good, i was kind of disappointed by the book. it was so hyped up and i was expecting so much that i think it just fell flat for me. i thought this was going to be a romance heavy book and while there was romance, i don’t think it was meant to be the main focus. i loved kath and lily and honestly wish we had gotten a lot more from them. i also feel like there wasn’t a lot of romantic payoff at the end of the book. again… i just felt disappointed. i did however really appreciate lily’s struggles with her homosexuality and thought it was very realistic. some aspects really reminded me of my own journey. although, the second hand anxiety i got from the later sections of the book was very intense and i do advise discretion when reading. i think one of the biggest issues i had had to deal with the ending and the payoff from multiple storylines. i just feel like we ended the book with a lot of things unresolved. shirley’s storyline, lily’s dad’s papers, the communist plot line, lana and tommy, kath and lily’s relationship… just to name a few. it was a very unsatisfying ending. i feel like a lot was missing and the book ended with 50 pages missing. i did like the book though. historical gay fiction is something i need more of in my life so i’ll take it where i can get it.   Last Night at the Telegraph Club is a novel that garnered a lot of popularity when it first released, and I've wanted to read it for quite some time (but you know how TBR shelves are). I'm so glad my YA lit class gave me an opportunity to finally dive in! I absolutely adored everything about this novel. I feel like the intersection between the Lily's identities as a Chinese-American and lesbian allowed for both topics to be explored in a way that is so often left out in conversations. Another thing I thought was interesting was how expertly Lo created tension just by exploring the setting. Conflicts between Lily and Shirley, the danger of Lily being outed, the government's homophobia and racism, the inherent danger of the situation with Lily's father, the cleverly placed flashbacks with the various adult characters, and most of all the time in which the story is set all offered the idea that anything could happen from any side, and as such had me constantly nervous as I turned the page.  Lily was an excellent protagonist. At first, I was a little concerned about Lily's friends constantly stepping all over her and her not taking a stand (as some of the books I've read have romanticized these toxic friendships), but I was thrilled as the story continued and Lily's growth allowed her to take a stand for herself! I also loved her relationship with Kath, specifically how healthy their relationship was. Overall I thought the novel was wonderful, and can't recommend it enough!  What a revelation to read a piece of historical fiction that featured a queer Asian-American young adult protagonist. I CANNOT EVEN. So many layers to unpack here and I have great respect for Lo, the research that clearly went into this text and the amount I learned about this time period in American history, California history, and Chinese-American history. One of the most beautiful things about this text, to me, is the way that Lo really captures the nuance of the coming out process for those of us who experience powerful feelings of self-knowing amidst cultural messages telling us that what we feel is wrong. Rarely do coming out novels explore with such depth the ways in which the coming out process can be spurred by attraction to another but is ultimately about an awakening/realization of identity inside of the self. I really loved that about this novel. I am also always grateful for novels that remind me to be grateful for my place in time and in awe of the women who have come before me, and to always remember that they were as full and real human beings as me, never relegating them to their circumstances or place in time.   Five stars! This book has my whole heart. The romance between Lily and Kath was the best part. It was so sweet and innocent but also a little bit dangerous? I loved that they were able to discover things about themselves together while growing in their friendship and love. Also loved the way the characters were written. While I didn’t love all the characters necessarily (SHIRLEY), I could appreciate their part in the story. It didn’t seem like there were any filler characters—each person had a part in the story where they were important and they fit into Lily’s journey. Obviously, I cried in the last part. The sibling relationships weren’t talked about too much, but I definitely cried when Eddie told Lily he’d beat people up at school for her. Reminded me of my younger brother. Overall, this is the best book I’ve read so far this year, and I’d definitely recommend it to all my friends. I think the message for young sapphics is very important and clear in this book, as it is overwhelmingly hopeful and sweet. Also I’m going to write a self insert fic for myself and Lana bc she deserves better than Tommy thnx ✌🏻 CW for homophobia, racism, misogyny, miscarriage and drinking/drugs/sex.  Lesbians in 1950's San Fran? Sign me up!This was a very refreshing read. I was always waiting for the other shoe to drop and it never did. Of course, being queer comes with hardships and the story shows that. And doesn't attempt to romanticize the suffering like other stories i've read or seen have done. These two girls just deserve a better world than the one they're living in, but seeing their slow burn romance unfold is adorable.Spoilers!!!Different perspective chapters sprinkled in there was nice, but I was really rooting for a bit more nuance in Lily's family especially since these chapters focused mainly on them. Especially, Aunt Judy. But I guess it is more realistic to not have a miracle ending where Lily gets to stay in San Fran (I legit thought that maybe in the last pages Judy was gonna be like: Sike! I've arranged for you to stay here secretly, and actually i am also secretly a bisexual and I understand you... or sth like that lol)"She had an infinite number of chances to turn back, but she refused to turn her back on Kath." This kinda encompasses the whole book. I really expected there to be a fallout at some point between the two, but I was pleasantly surprised how earnest this love story was portrayed. The girls were allowed to figure out their sexuality without having to add unnecessary drama to propel the story forward, but with the support of other queer people in a safe space. Of course you have Shirley, and Lily's parents, but when her brother tucks her into her blanket, I was crying right there with Lily.Also, I love the whole gang of lesbians they meet, and I will never get over the found family trope, and I am slightly disappointed Terry and Lana did not take both Kath and Lily under their wings immediately.  3.75 stars.I really enjoyed this one. It took me a while to get through but that’s not because of the book. That’s just me not picking up books and reading.It was really refreshing reading LGBT+ historical fiction and I 100% want more! It was so interesting to learn about the lesbian culture back in the 1950s and the Chinese-American history.Only reason this book didn’t get four stars is because of the ending. If it was just 20 pages or so longer, just so I know if Kath and Lily are happy, I would of given it four stars. I just want to know if they are happy. They so deserve to be happy!!On the other hand Shirley does not deserve to be happy. I couldn’t stand her character and would of happily thrown her off a cliff multiple times.But yes overall definitely want more LGBT+ historical fiction please! Throw all the recommendations at me. I don’t mind making my mountain of a TBR pile bigger, haha   3.5/5 ✩ | she felt a queer giddiness overtaking her, as if her body might float up from the ground because she was so buoyant with this lightness, this love.- i absolutely adored this book, it was such a beautiful read. it was just the right amount of descriptive, making the writing style just flow so perfectly. following lily's story was just a whole experience which was just amazing.- personally, i unfortunately didn't feel an attachment to lily and kath due to the such little moments they had which was one reason my rating slightly lowered but i felt the story was so much more than then but rather lily's personal journey.- the chapters before a new part were a little on and off for me. i understand they were there to create story depth and have more of an understanding for the other characters but in the end, i couldn't really care less other than a FEW moments within those chapters. this was another reason why my rating lowered as well. Un romance contemporaneo ambientato alla Chinatown a San Francisco. Le due protagonisti sono Lily e Kath, due ragazze che si incontrano e si innamorano. Tutto con lo sfondo del Telegraph club nei anni 50. Ho amato tantissimo questo libro. Con i suoi capitoli corti, riesce ad alzare l’attenzione del lettore e far crescere l voglia di andare avanti. Ottimi anche i personaggi, ben caratterizzati e che si muovono bene. Inoltre ho apprezzato tantissimo i temi trattati come l’omosessualità, la cultura cinese e il razzismo ma anche altri. L’autrice è riuscita a documentarsi, sia per l’aspetto storico sia per l’aspetto linguistico (trovando documenti e facendo i vari riferimenti. Potrebbe risultare noioso perché comunque si tratta di un romance ma devo dire che sono rimasta soddisfatta della lettura e lo rileggerei volentieri.   Mackenzi Lee's frequent mentioning of the author made me really curious to read It. It's a historical fiction with an authentic lesbian culture in 1950s. Our main protagonist lily is an american born chinese and yes, that comes with a bold tagline of RACISM. Author beautifully captured that too. Telegraph club is a queer late night club solely for queer women and how this club binded a string to their real life is a fascinating journey depicted in this book. Firstly I enjoyed the historical accuracy and well observed view and accurate recreation of that era. We got to know the different definition of immigrant life from different perspective. Also the uprising of communism and how people belittled the thought everything gave an extra sidekick along with the lesbian main plot. But The book is excessively slow. And constant changing of timeline and leaving many subplots loosely, which gave an ambiguity to the story indeed but did not contribute much to the plot, so that wasn’t a good idea in my opinion. So I'll be settled with a rating of 3.5 or 4 (maybe) And i do recommend it..(probably I'll read some more from this author)  4,5 stars—My judgement is always clouded because of the ending, but I’ll accept it. The middle of the book was somewhat slow, therefore the .5 stars and not 5 stars.Other than that, this was a very, VERY gay book, and so so cute. It’s been a while since I’ve read a purely lesbian romance novel, so it felt so good to have a book about falling in love with a girl. There’s this thing about the word “girlfriend” that I absolutely love. You know how sometimes you see the word girlfriend and you think “oh okay”, but then you read it in a lesbian context and you’re just filled with joy? Yeah, that. That was pretty much what this entire book felt like to me. Anyway, read it. I also very much want to have some Chinese food right now because every time they talk about the food they’re having I get so jealous  4.5 stars1950s Chinatown in San Francisco? Sapphic romance? Girls with the desire to make or fly planes? Sounds perfect, and it was. Lili and Kath are just such amazing characters, and the vivid description of their interactions make for such a realistic reading experience. I really adored Lili exploring the world around her, getting to a better sense and understanding of herself and her place in world. In my opinion impeccable writing (the flashbacks were such a lovely touch).,Would highly recommend picking this up, especially if you’re into sapphic contemporariers or (queer) historical fiction! Content warnings: racism, xenophobia, homophobia, mentions of deportation, underage drinking, brief mention of miscarriage, offensive/outdated language (relevant to the time)  The first word that comes to mind when trying to review this novel is "aching." This book aches. Aches with coming-of-age pains, aches with longing, aches with the need to belong, aches with displacement and microaggressions.  It made me ache, and I loved every page. The recent winner of the National Book Award, Last Night at the Telegraph Club is a dutifully researched and creatively told story of Lily, a Chinese American in the 1950's who struggles with her gay identity, rising racism in the threat of Communism, family. LNATTC never goes overboard to deliver what readers want: an explosion of identity and risks...no, instead Lo keeps very tight reins on her character to make sure this YA book reads as hyper-realistic and lovingly painful. I especially loved the parent's chapters, as they added much nuance to their characters.It ached in my brain and lingered in my heart. Last Night at the Telegraph Club is a beautiful, timely, and moving historical piece.  Cuando supe que este libro trataba de lesbianas en San Francisco en los años 50 supe que TENÍA que leerlo.No ha llegado a cumplir todas mis expectativas, pero aun así es una lectura que me ha gustado y que recomiendo. No es solo una historia de amor sáfica en una época en la que básicamente estaba prohibido ser gay, sino que mezcla problemas familiares, políticos y raciales. La familia de la protagonista, Lili, es china y se enfrentan al miedo de ser deportados. Además, tienen unas expectativas muy altas hacia ella y no encontrará en ellos el apoyo que necesita mientras se descubre a si misma, sino todo lo contrario. Por ello, buscará eso que su familia no puede darle en un bar LGTB clandestino, donde por primera vez sentirá que encaja y puede ser quien es.  4-4.5 stars. I didn't think I'd be that into historical fiction, but this was a really enjoyable read! I felt like I could relate to Lily in a lot of ways as a Chinese American daughter as she navigates growing up with all of her family's expectations. Although I wish some of the other characters were more developed and explored from their own perspectives, I found myself getting into the emotions of the book, squealing with Lily during exciting, happy times, but also becoming angry and upset at society during the more difficult moments too. After reading this book, I'm even more grateful that we now live in a society where LGBTQ+ issues are more widely talked about and normalized in society.  CW: homophobia, racism, brief glimpses of war woundsThis is beautiful and interesting and aching. So many powerful moments; "You will never look at me like that again," destroys me. I loved Lily and Kath and their journey to each other and self acceptance. I really enjoyed learning more about lesbian culture in 50s San Fran and the lives of Chinese Americans, something I don't know much about from this time period. The undercurrent of fear and racism throughout the book is exhausting and all too real. This book is just such a cross section of culture and feminism and civil liberties and coming of age.  I am marking this as finished because I am putting it aside for now - not because the book is not good but because idk if I am in the right space for it. I love the way Lo writes about SF during this time period - it is so vivid and clearly drawn from copious research about communities that do not often get a lot of coverage in the history of the city. My issue with the book has to do with the distance I feel from the characters - I have had this issue with other Lo books too. But this is a me problem, not a problem with the book. It is exceptionally well written, probably the best of hers I have read, and I am so glad she gave this story life.  In 1950s Chinatown, Lily doesn't quite fit in, because she wants to be a rocket scientist, and because she's intrigued by women who dress like men. When she discovers a classmate, Kath, who takes her to the Telegraph Club, a bar where male impersonators perform, Lily finds a place where she feels like herself. This was an engrossing novel about a little-known subculture. While the timeline and flashbacks to the lives of Lily's parents and aunt didn't seem to be hugely important, it did help to flesh out the world Lily grew up in and how immigration and politics played into creating the Red Scare that made any deviation from the norm appear dangerous to the authorities. The pace moved along nicely for a historical novel, and the mix of different cultures (Chinese and gay/lesbian) made for a story that managed to teach without feeling didactic. Lily's coming out and her relationship with Kath felt very realistic.  What a way to end my 2021 reading year! To sum this book up, it is a stunning story about our main character Lily, and how she learns to live in 1950’s San Francisco as both Chinese American and a lesbian “in spaces that often did not allow both to coexist”. The writing is beautiful, I was obsessed with Lily and Kath’s romance, and the setting of both San Francisco and the titular Telegraph Club is so unique and vivid. This made my heart swell and gutted me all in one story. There are so many readers out there who will relate to this book even more than I did, and I’m so happy that it has found/is finding that audience. Highly recommend!  There's plenty good things to say about this book. It's reasonable fine to read, it's refreshing to read about a protagonist with Chinese ancestry in the 50s, and it's a time travel to some extent. The love between the two girls develops slowly and painfully, transporting readers back to their own youth where being not-straight was everything but easy.However, it does not always feel like the 50s, but stays on the surface a bit. The writing in general is lacking, as was the case with the other Lo book I've read.The all-compassing question that lingers, though, is: Do we really need another book about lesbian love being difficult?  the research and care put into this novel is obvious from the first page. this is a novel that was well-loved by every hand who worked on it; the love is just so obvious. love for the characters, the setting, the romance, and queer history. i’m reminded of (and humbled by) the struggle that gay and lesbian people went through in the past, how they carved our lives for themselves and held their truths close, despite the ever-present danger. and while things aren’t perfect, it means a lot that i can hold my gf’s hand in public without getting arrested. comparatively, a few weird looks mean little. this was an absolutely gorgeous book from first page to last.  it's not a happy ending. but it's a hopeful one. and that's what matters.the intersection of a chinese identity with a queer one is, in my opinion, so complex due to the lack of words that can span across the language barrier. add that to the filial obligations that are so prevalent in chinese american homes and... yeah.malinda lo did a great job of depicting the parents' reactions--they aren't just mindless homophobes, they're people. and they love lily despite everything. eddie's reaction, too, made me cry, although i cry whenever i see siblings talking to one another.i can see this becoming a great american novel.   Chinatown, San Fransisco, 1950s. Lily is navigating high school, baby queer feelings, and the racism/homophobia/sexism in the United States. No big deal, totally manageable. Except Lily starts hanging out with a new girl from school, Kath, who makes Lily feel…different and excited. Follows are the adventures of their relationship and San Fran in the 50s. My thoughts: what started out slowly, turned out to be an incredible read. The slow start gives you the historical fiction portion of the book, with character development that made it easy to love Lily and hate some other people. The research in writing this book is also very evident; there is incredible information at the end of the book about the US during this time period. Verdict? A fantastic book to finish 2022 with. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️  When I was a teen, Malinda's books ASH and HUNTRESS were such a comfort - not only were they wonderfully written and a great escape, but they also were the first time I saw LGBTQIA+ characters represented in a book. Suffice to say, I was so delighted when I saw this book was releasing. Whilst it was pretty heartbreaking at points, Lily's story has stayed with me since I finished it this weekend and I absolutely loved how vividly Lo depicted the world and how she stitched together the past and (in book) present. I can't wait to see what she brings out next!   This book is amazing. The history is incredibly well-researched, and the author brilliantly weaves the cultural, historical, and social themes into a rich &amp; compelling story. While discussing with my wife, the words "nuanced", "honest", and "gentle, but firm" kept coming up. I didn't even realize this is considered YA, since Lo avoids most of the common YA tropes (or takes familiar setups into more thoughtful directions). It also helps that she fleshed out Lily's parents and other family members to provide a broader perspective.I certainly related to Lily's experience as an American-born child of immigrants (and a space-nerd to boot), although she (obviously) had more dimensions to wrangle. And as with all of my favorite books, i loved the vivid writing style - i could almost feel the crisp air on my face, walking the hilly streets of San Francisco as the fog rolls in over the bay.  I can’t even describe how fantastic this was and it showed up out of nowhere at a time where I was beginning to doubt whether I’d become too picky about my books and wouldn’t find a 5 star again. BUT THIS BOOK! This had it all from the very first page. It made my heart flutter, made me embarrassed when Lily was and it made me cry. I could imagine them being at The Telegraph Club and as Lily went through her nights there, so did I. I could almost smell the cigarettes and taste the cheap champagne. IT WAS SO GOOD! Romance done right.  I wish I could give this book 100 stars. And that still wouldn't be enough. I really don't have the words. I sometimes say I don't like historical fiction because so much of it romanticizes historical periods that were terrible for most people, but sometimes I also love historical fiction. When it's like this. When it's so good it hurts. Without the veneer of the "good old days." I also loved that the main character wasn't the bravest, boldest, toughest girl around. She was uncomfortable, scared, and so much easier to relate to. I just wanted to see her have a happy ending. I wanted her to be able to be everything she wanted. I loved this book  I loved this book so much. The slower pace serves to put you right into Lily’s day to day as a Chinese American teen who is discovering more about herself in 1950s San Francisco. I really liked how this book talked about being at the crossroads of identity, age, race, family and love. It was also interesting to see the juxtaposition of Lily’s and Kathleen’s relationship with the past experiences of her parents and aunt, told through flashbacks. They felt real, as they tackled their past and present. Overall, I just got lost in the slow burn romance and Lily’s life. The author’s note in the back of the book also gave a lot of insight to everything going on in that period of time, for those interested. I think I definitely want to know more about San Francisco and it’s history with the queer community.  4.5 starsthis was a deeply emotional read, I carried Lily and her feelings with me even as I went about my day and the book stayed in my room.this might be the, to me personally, most relatable sapphic narration I've ever come across.this book tackles and touches a great number of issues and it takes its time, making the first half a little slow, but I found it rather unputdownable all the way through despite this.and yes, I did cry multiple times throughout the book's climax.the one actual complaint I have that keeps me from making this a full 5 star is that, despite the romance being incredibly sweet, I felt like we didn't get to know Kath very deeply. the romance mainly still worked due to the simple fact that I was rooting for Lily and her happiness with my whole chest.  Rounded up from a 4.5. This book is a YA coming of age story about Lily Hu, a 17yo Chinese American girl from San Francisco Chinatown in the 1950s. In the midst of American paranoia about Chinese Communists and her best friend competing to be the next Miss Chinatown, Lily is figuring herself out as she finds herself drawn to a lesbian nightclub adjacent to her neighborhood, falling in love with a classmate, and pursuing her passion in STEM. As historical fiction, this book was well researched and did a wonderful job opening up &amp; imagining what life in the 1950s would have been like in this pocket of the world for someone like Lily, and I loved how it explored Lily’s connections and tensions with the communities she is a part of. Though the first half of the book moved a little slow for me, it picks up in the second half. Really wonderful book!  Last Night at the Telegraph Club is a book I've heard about many times and I'm really glad I finally prioritized reading it. This young adult historical fiction novel is winning all the awards and I can definitely see why. Lo touches on so many issues in the 1950s that our main character Lily, a Chinese American, must suffer through. I learned a lot more about America's fear of The Red Scare (Communism) and it's obvious Lo did a lot of research. This character driven novel is beautifully written and I would definitely recommend it for older teens and adults alike!  Yes yes yes yes yes yes YES. I loved this. Everything about this hit me smack dab in the heart. I just felt such a deep connection to the this story, the setting, and felt like I was walking in the shoes of these characters. And for that, this was such a transportive reading experience. Ultimately a coming of age story, we follow Lily as she navigates her sexuality in 1950s San Francisco’s Chinatown. I absolutely loved Lily and Kath as characters. They both felt so real and alive.The meshing of historical context, rich scene setting, and character development made for such an interesting read. The plot is fairly straightforward, but it was so difficult to put down. There were so many themes layered into this novel and Lo was able to capture it all so seamlessly. And the author’s note at the end was so informative and definitely worth the read!  it was incredible, i learned so much, the main character was so well developed, the atmosphere was both beautiful and sad, i loved iti just had to take a star off because i was just a little bored at times, especially with the flashbacks, but anyone who is a regular reader of historical fiction, and actually just anyone in general, should most definitely take the time to read this beautiful, heartbreaking, intricate story.  This book had me absolutely enthralled. The plot somehow was so calm but so addicting at the same time, making me never want to put the book down. As a lesbian, it perfectly encapsulates the shame that comes with that realization, and how horrible it feels to hide it. As someone closeted with a less than supportive family, this book was absolutely heart wrenching and at times felt like someone was peeking into my brain. 100% would recommend, I don’t think I’ve ever cried harder reading a book.  I'm glad I saw other reviews of this before I read this, otherwise I would have been absolutely caught off-guard by how sweet and moving this book was. Lo manages to string together a bunch of plot elements in a way that makes sense and works well. Normally I don't love books that move back and forth in time, but Lo did it so beautifully and with such impact that it added to the book.I just loved the story. I mean, it was good enough to begin with, but the fact that there is a whole dedicated sub plot about space travel?? Count me in. This book was just great. I loved it. I loved everything about it.   3.5* 🌟[mais um lido com gabzinha 🤍]confesso que não costumo ler muitos livros desse gênero (ficção histórica), mas adorei! é um livro muito coming of age e por isso acho que as partes finais me deixaram mais animadas/presa na leitura. eu adorei acompanhar a jornada da lily se autoconhecendo, sabe? e tudo isso num contexto histórico que deixou tudo mais interessante.o que quebrava um pouco o ritmo pra mim, foram os capítulos da família dela misturado com outros, mas entendo que sua importância pra autora ter feito isso, então apesar de me deixar um pouco perdida, me dizia os fatos históricos muito importantes para a história.⚠️ aponto aqui como conteúdo sensível: homofobia, que é extremamente forte nesse livro e pode ser gatilho para quem for ler!   The bloom of first love can be so wonderful, thrilling and confusing all at the same time. Especially if you are a Chinese-American, lesbian, teenager in 1950s San Francisco and don't know it yet. I lost count of how many times this beautiful young girl on the cusp of adulthood blushed, turned crimson, or felt the hot flush of embarrassment creeping up her neck and face as she navigates friendships, high school drama, her first love and the societal expectations of both her home and community in Chinatown.The author perfectly captures this universal teen experience - how awkward fumbling, humiliation, embarrassment and ostracization can happen in an instant and is sometimes not reversible. This is a gem of a love story for LGBTQ readers as well.  such a powerful story, which offers deep insight to growing up as a queer chinese american teen in the 50s, having to face racism and homophobia.the protagonist is so relatable and authentic, plus the writing is very atmospheric and detailed which i am obsessed with.i think this story, even though it takes place over 60 years ago, is as relevant as ever!!  Very sweet lesbian YA set in 1950s San Francisco. I wanted it to be about 150 pages shorter. The author clearly put a ton of work into researching the specific geographic/social/historical context and while she paints a vivid picture in that way, I wish more work had gone into giving the characters more depth and texture. I didn’t feel like the flashbacks for the mom, dad, or aunt added much and I wish they had! Nonetheless, well-written and an overall pleasant read. I hope Lo writes a steamier non-YA romance in the future!  I loved this book so much! This was a very hyped book, and I hoped that the audiobook would live up to the hype for me. I'm so happy today that it did, and I was surprised by how much I loved this book. Last Night at the Telegraph Club is filled with fantastic characters. The story of this novel was interesting because although we know about clubs like the Telegraph Club, not many people write about clubs like this. Historical Fiction is one of my favorite genres, and Malinda Lo writes the genre perfectly. Romance plays a part in Last Night at the Telegraph Club, but I also loved the story of finding yourself and finding people like yourself. I recommend this book to people that love Historical Fiction.   I really enjoyed this as it hit many marks for me and I had heard a lot of good things. I was not disappointed. I really enjoyed the story but as usual, I'm always distressed to read about people being oppressed and it's worse when these things happen to those that are close to us. Lily was a good character and this story was very engaging.  Sólo imaginar la época del año 1950, en EEUU, la ciudad de San Francisco, lo difícil para dos chicas de 17 años que se dan cuenta de su orientación sexual, en una época de tanta represión, dónde la homosexualidad era vista como una desviación o peor aún como una enfermedad... Y a parte de ésto tratar de ligarla al comunismo?! Guaoooo mucha tela que cortar!... Está es una historia Slow Burn, algo complicada por la época; cuenta la historia de estas dos chicas, Lily Hu y Kathleen Miller. Lily Hu, una chinoamericana (nacida en EEUU) y Kathleen Miller, una chica americana, que se enamoran, y que deben mantener su amor de manera clandestina, entre el colegio y un Club Nocturno de ambiente.Debo confesar que se me hizo una historia bastante densa, demasiado descriptiva y explicativa de zonas y áreas de San Francisco, que hacían por momentos que la historia se hiciese un poco tediosa, finalmente entre la 3era y 4ta parte es cuando se torna emocionante y prácticamente salva la historia...La parte más interesante de todo el libro? la investigación realizada por la autora... Cabe destacar, que ha pesar de ser una historia ficticia, en parte está inspirada en su familia. No debió ser nada fácil ser homosexual en la época de los años 50, y mucho más difícil, culturalmente hablando, para Lily... Muy complicada, y llegué a sentir su sufrimiento!Vale la pena ésta lectura? Sí, sobretodo su parte histórica... Ahora creo entender un poco más la lucha de la comunidad LGBTIQ+  loved it from start to finish, being so young coming out made it even more touching for me. and the ending was SO GOOD? i’m always so disheartened by endings of books but this one touched my heart. “She felt queer giddiness overtaking her, as if her body might float up from the ground because she was so buoyant with this lightness, this love.” !!!!  4/5"We're never what our parents expected." I loved this, it was so sweet but also so sad at the same time. The setting in San Francisco's Chinatown was so cool to dive into and I really enjoyed the character development. Found family is one of my favorite tropes and I'm so happy how this book incorporated that into this. Lily and Kath were just perfect.   What a really lovely first read of 2021! I’ve never read any Malindo Lo before, but I was very interested in this historical YA exploring the intersection of lesbian culture and Chinese American culture. And I’m so impressed! I thought this was a really excellent book, Lo really captures such a clear picture of life in the 50s. The book is absolutely dripping in lesbian culture, and I think the historic details and setting were written exceedingly well.Last Night at the Telegraph Club follows Chinese American Lily, a baby gay who is just beginning to realise there is something different about her. She becomes friends with the only other girl in her advanced math class who introduces her to a lesbian club, the Telegraph Club, where she begins to explore her identity and tries to figure out how she can be both Chinese American and lesbian.I thought Lo did an absolutely brilliant job of writing in this time period. You can really tell everything has been so excellently researched. It’s quite a slow book because a lot of time is spent on lots of small details and worldbuilding around the 50s time period, from larger details like the Red Scare/communism, down to the small things to do with clothes or food. I can definitely see that some people might not like this style. But I love books like this, ones that really give you such a perfectly clear vision of the world and setting. I loved the exploration of queer identity during this time period in particular, Lo drops subtle details that really help show what life was like for queer people in this era – my absolute favourite moment of this was Lily being fascinated by the lesbian pulp novels she found at the back of a drug store, and these being what led her to first start thinking she might be lesbian. It’s so funny to me that in the 50s queer people were discovering their identities in the same way I did 70 years later: just through a slightly different medium of literature (pulp novel in a drug store, vs fanfic online!)The relationship between Kath and Lily was also expertly written. I think it might be one of my favourite relationships in YA. There was such a sense of magic and beauty that is so inherent in your first teenage relationship. It really captured that sense of first love, but in a very queer way – that sense of happiness when you first figure out what your feelings mean, that pure joy when you touch someone, but also that sense of shame and guilt that sometimes follows. The juxtaposition of the shame and happiness was written particularly well, and Lily’s journey to fit her lesbian culture into her Chinese American family was really exceptionally written and very honest.There were some small issues I had. My main complaint is the small sections interspaced throughout Lily’s story where we got a POV from Lily’s parents or aunts from several years previously. I know these probably were included to give a better understanding of the time period and more history for the communism plot line but they felt very out of place to me. I didn’t really care about them at all, they just kept taking me out of Lily’s story – sometimes even at big cliffhanger moments!! Tell me what’s happening to Lily and Kath please and not her parents 20 years ago! It did also end quite abruptly. After quite a slow, tender and gentle story, the ending felt very rushed in comparison.But overall, I thought this was a really excellent historical fiction YA. This book just exudes lesbian culture and it was fascinating to read about this time period and explore how queer culture developed during a time where it was illegal. I also thought Lo expertly explores the intersection of Lily’s lesbian and Chinese American culture, it felt like a very honest and very personal story and was beautifully written.----Maybe closer to a 4.5? This was really great, the way Lo explores lesbian culture in the 50s was excellent!! Full review to come!  this is my first five star book of the year, and i have to say that i am so incredibly glad that this was the first one.last night at the telegraph club is such a beautiful novel, filled with longing, figuring out your identity and sticking true to who you are. this is one of these novels that grips you from page one and lets you feel along with the main character, it doesn't let you go, not even after the first page.it's hard hitting and not an easy read at times - lily does go through trauma that will probably never let her go. but that is just the beauty of it. while it is a lesbian novel all about being queer in the 1950's and merging an american-chinese culture with being queer, it is not a pity party. it is a show of how strong people can be, and just how strong lesbian love can be.i adored this book from page one to the very last page. the epilogue was just so beautiful. i felt with lily - i felt her love and anger and her disappointments, her frustrations. if you do yourself any kinds of favor - do yourself one by picking up this book. this is the kind of novel i wished had been out there when i was young and figuring out that i was a lesbian.tldr; this book is beautiful and if you love yourself, you should pick it up  the pacing was a bit off, and the timeline and different perspective time jumps didn't really do anything for me, but overall a really great read and a really beautiful story. would highly recommend!  such a sweet story &amp; a very easy read - i finished it within a day. also v refreshing to read a 1950s wlw story (my brand, gotta love some vintage lesbians) that isn’t entirely focused on white women (lily is asian american). i loved it &lt;3 I so wish I had had this book in high school. This is such a beautiful, well-researched story. I loved reading about lesbian bars and pulp novels in the 50s through the point of view of Lily. I wish there had been a little bit more characterization of Kath and some of the flashbacks threw me out of the story for a little bit, but otherwise, this book was so, so good!   
  
    She didn't understand the shrinking feeling inside her, as if she shouldn't be caught looking at those girls.
  
Last Night at the Telegraph Club is a historical coming of age fiction set in 1950's San Francisco - with a major focus in Chinatown - that follows the story of Lily, a teenager born in America from a family of Chinese immigrants, as she comes to terms with her own sexuality. Although it doesn't have a particularly fast-paced rhythm and an action-packed plot full of shocking events - on the contrary, most of the book flows with a placid and refinedly delicate rhythm - the storyline is fascinating and managed to keep me glued to the pages, eager to know how things would evolve for the main character Lily and her friend (turning significant other) Kath.I found their relationship and the discovery of their "taboo" first love very tender and heartmoving, and given how well the social and cultural enviroment of the time is described, it's even easier to emphatize with our protagonists and support them through their difficult journey. 
  
    She wondered if Kath could sense her, sitting on this train as it took her away. Perhaps it was possible, if she closed her eyes and sent out her thoughts along the steel track like a message along a telephone wire. I love you. I love you. The train swayed gently beneath her, and she leaned against the window to feel the cool glass against her cheek, and she was sure that Kath had heard her, she was sure.
  
I was particularly fascinated by how well the author described the setting: I could really imagine in my head the Chinatown of the 1950s, its colors and smells; I was able to get to know its traditions and get lost in its streets; and I could feel the uncertainty of a Chinese family struggling with the difficult and delicate political situation, all while trying to adapt to the American way of life.
  
    The sensation of having already met someone, or what the French called deja vu, the feeling of having already seen something. There was probably a scientific explanation for it, but the older she got, the more she was inclined to give ino the the feeling that these moments were glimpses into a world greater than this physical one. 
  
Howerall, I enjoyed this book more than I expected. I thought I would only find a cute love story, instead I dreamed and cried with Lily and Kath and hoped until the end that things would turn out well for them.  Wow. I don't really know what to say. I absolutely love this book. The only accurate description of how I'm feeling right now is Macey's review of it. I have no idea what I'm supposed to do now after reading this. Wow. This is one of the best books I’ve ever read. The storytelling and characters are so beautifully crafted. Lily’s coming out experience reminded me a lot of my own, so it was beautiful to see the way the book ended with hope.  É um livro cuja história tinha imenso potencial, mas ficou aquém das minhas expectativas. Isto porque é dada muita relevância ao contexto e à explicação de pormenores não tão relevantes, enquanto se descarta a parte romântica entre as protagonistas (o que, para mim, era o que merecia maior enfoque).  nie przepadam za literaturą młodzieżową, ale ta książka okazała się być pozytywnym zaskoczeniem!! trochę brakowało mi mocniejszego zagłębiania się w umysły postaci, a niektóre dialogi brzmiały nieco sztucznie, aaaale koniec końców jest to całkiem dobrze napisana powieść  4.5 starsI loved the storyline and the historical context, but I found the writing a little dry. I think the book probably could have been 50 pages shorter. Frankly, I wanted more scenes with Kath and Lily together.Otherwise, this was a fascinating view into what it was like to be gay and Chinese-American in San Francisco in the 1950s. Also, it was SO cool to hear this author speak AS I was reading the book! I really admire Malinda Lo. She paved the way for YA literature with queer, Asian, female characters. I loved hearing her story.  I honestly don't have words for how much I am absolutely in love with this story, and Lily and Kath's experiences. So much of it hits so awfully close to home, and yes, I ugly cried many times in the final few chapters.This was one of my most anticipated releases of the year and, well, consider this one of my all-time favorite reads. I am begging everyone to read this story as it's so beautiful and honestly, still so relevant to many queer people's lives.   I really want to come back to this, but I'm trying to start April with as clean a slate as possible, and I'm just not making much progress on this. What I have read so far, I have really enjoyed. im not really a historical fiction fan but this was amazing, warm, reassuring (lesbian found family,, anyone??) and a little too relatable Absolutely stunning.If, like me, you were afraid to read this because you were worried it would be super depressing, don’t worry, it’s not. It ends on a lovely hopeful note. “and her mother’s face swam into focus, her brown eyes full of the sharp worry of love, and lily thought, you still never look at me like this again”wow. this book. it did so many good things and i don’t think i have the right words to talk about them all. it perfectly encapsulated the isolation and curiosity and the feeling of rightness when learning about lesbians and your feelings. it hit really close to home on that front for me. and it also was beautifully written and i loved every single page that i turned. seriously, read this book.   3.5/5Overall I really enjoyed this book. However I had a really hard time with the pace, which is why I’m not giving it a higher rating.  4.5 stars!1950’s historical fiction about Chinese lesbian coming of age! This was really good!! didn’t think it would make me cry,,, but it did 4.5/5 &lt;3 i loved this book sm  Really good story with interesting characters, but could be a bit slow at times. I would probably give it a 3.9 or 3.8 if goodreads did decimals. This book feels like a hug and a blanket in a cold day but it also made my heart ache in some moments...the epilogue made me cry so much, at least they love each other no matter what😢. 4,5 If I could, I'd give this 6 stars! An amazing story of a young Chinese/American girl's coming over age in 1950's San Francisco. Brilliantly researched and wonderfully written. A must read! I really liked the setting and overall premise. However, I felt like there were a lot of loose ends when it came to plot points and one of the main characters (the main love interest, in fact) was seriously underdeveloped and I had no concept of who she was, which limited my emotional investment in the characters’ stories.   This book deserves all the praise and awards it’s been getting !!! Truly phenomenal  4.75 I loved this book. I don't have many specific thoughts on it besides that I just thought it was a cute queer romance. I liked that it was historical fiction and liked how 1940's Chinese culture had such an influence on the plot. It was very reminiscent of The Joy Luck Club (a book that I absolutely despise) however I think I got out of LNATTC what I didn't out of TJLC in terms of Chinese culture.  4.5⭐️loooooved it hit too close to home literalmente emotionally drained pero contentísima quiero un montón a mi lily me ha gustado un montón un montón muy contenta y soltando lagrimillas  1. Narrator 會説中文為這本書加分不少，雖然有些發音也不是那麽準XD，但真心推薦有聲版。2. 喜歡這部小説的年代感，還有美籍華人的身份元素（以前有那麽一陣子很喜歡看美籍華人電影）3. 但總的說，YA Fiction還真不是我的茶啊哈 It was a little slow in the middle, but an overall good book! 4.5 :) lesbians!!!!!!!!! this was super cute I totally recommend 4.5 Do not read this book thinking its about a magic night club. Its not. It's just a regular night club. There is no magic here.But the story is very cute, enjoyed it. Asian-American and gay struggles? Yeah this book did it for me.  actual rating: 3.5 stars. review to come? this one kind of slightly broke my heart. lily deserves the whole world and her coming of age in this book was so sweet but so so sad. i also really liked how realistic everything was, especially the portrayal of the typical unforgiving asian parents/household. tbh the romance (or just kath) itself wasn’t very memorable but i think it was more a catalyst for lily’s whole journey and was written beautifully!  4,5⭐️ este libro es casita no me lo esperaba nada así suuuuperfeliz lo q quiero a mi lily💘💘💘 I finished this book feeling profoundly grateful that I don't have to hide my relationship, that at least there were some resources around to figure out my identity when I did, and I didn't get arrested for existing. Anyhoo. I really liked this book. Lily's adolescent confusion and 'oh god, the yearning' was very well written. I also liked the examination of anti-Asian racism, homophobia in general and the space race.  This may be my favorite fiction book this year. This is such a beautiful coming of age love story set it the 1950's in San Francisco. It was absolutely perfect. 4 stars Historical coming of age story about navigating one's sexuality and identity while trying to meet the expectations of your family such a beautiful and painful story 3.5, this book made me very emotional but really didn’t like some of the subplots A must-read.  3.75/5* Fun read, I’m glad this book exists.

Very slow in the beginning but when it picks up (near 50%) it picks up fast. Ending felt a bit rushed, wished we'd seen more of Lily's life in Pasadena with her aunt and uncle. This is my first Malinda Lo book and I'm definitely going to check out her other work!  I am SO glad to have read this. beautiful, but of course heartbreaking. it was such a good mix of experiences from chinatown in san francisco, the gay club scene in the 50s, women in stem in the 50s... just a good thoughtful YA  Just brilliant Beautifully written, compelling characters, interesting backdrop of 1950s San Francisco. 4.5 stars. 4.5 stars rounded up I cried.  im going to need everyone to read this book.................... worth the hype and the hurt This book was just… everything. A perfect historical fiction book with excellent pacing. This book is seriously underrated.  Not necessarily bad but this took me forever to read. Months. So slow. But there were some scenes I really loved.  it was rly cute the end felt a little rushed should’ve been more smut 🤗 mannnnn i didnt think that 1950s san francisco lesbians can make me THIS emotional should be required reading. deserving of all the awards. I. LOVE. THIS. BOOK.  4.5! When I finished this story, I immediately wished I had another book about Lily and Kath so that I could keep reading about them. This book made my heart go ouch in the best way possible; a beautiful story ♥️  I have no idea how this book managed to be a sharp slap and a warm hug at the same time. But it did. Genuinely made me feel nauseous with emotion just wow This book was written with such love, care, and passion. heartbreaking at times (it’s a historical novel about a girl finding out she’s a lesbian in the 1950’s Chinatown of San Francisco, what do you reckon) but also warm and touching.get ready to feel. 3.5 stars! the plot has a lot of promise but the characters didnt feel very real and im a little disappointed by the storytelling. the ending was hasty and the generational flashbacks had little value. but loved the sf references!  I rounded up on this YA book as I appreciated a story of identity, queerness, prejudice and racism along with the history of the Chinese, specifically in SF. Loved the afterward with more history about Asian immigration, lesbians and 1950s America.  crying brb sweet &amp; tender - plus so well-researched, grounded in place &amp; history along so many axes (my only thought is that the narrator feels much younger, like early HS instead of 17?) I really liked this book! i feel an emptiness now i’ve finished this book, i don’t know another way to explain it &amp; i think it took me so long to finish because i knew i would feel this way. such a beautiful &amp; emotional story 3.5 muito fofo!!!!! personagens incríveis!!!!!! premissa maravilhosa!!!!! só achei que o final foi meio enrolado e apressado, mas até uns ~70% é perfeito i cried so much but the tears were all worth it. lily, my girl, you deserve all the best. i understand why it was slow paced, especially in the first half, but my brain was getting a little bored so it took me a really long time to finish it. however, i fairly enjoyed it and highly recommend it!!!!   that satisfying feeling when a book is even better than the reviews said it would be High 3 I love this book so much. Our teen librarian recommended it. It really does not disappoint. Great seeing fully realized lesbian characters and historical fiction. Young women on the brink of adulthood. Facing extraordinary challenges because of their sexuality. Outstanding book. A historical fiction YA that explores the importance of nightlife for the lesbian community - something I’ve never read before.  I'm fucking heartbroken, that's what I am Overall, Malinda Lo's setting really shows how great her characters are and vice-versa.Spoiler-free Review: https://amberinoface.wordpress.com/20... I received an ecopy of this book via Netgalley; however, my opinions are my own.  this is about lesbians.......with the word lesbian actually written in the book.....oh my godto be fair i think that this book wasn’t perfect and if i had to rate it more objectively it wouldn’t be a 5*. some plot points do have loose ends and could have used some further development......but the EMOTION ?i just want to feel this again for real.........also the author clearly did her research, the setting was so fascinating and the author’s note is so full of info about the historical period, lesbian culture, chinese culture, just loved that so much  The last 15/20% of this dropped this down for me - I can't put my finger on why, and honestly it might just be because it was at 9pm that I was finishing this.  A powerful story, beautifully and heartbreakingly told. It seemed much too drawn out in parts (lots of showing and listing of things being done in the beginning, rather than telling), but was still an excellent read. I appreciated the interlude chapters where we got perspective from Lily's parents and aunt as well as the excellent authors notes at the end, giving historical background on the story.  4.5, so lovely crying as i inoculate some tryptic soy broth with some platelets  this book destroyed me in the best way possible. 2.5 :/ i had such high expectations for this one! Heck this book was wonderful. Queer love story centered around an Asian-American woman. I find I rate books on how much they make me say my thoughts and emotions out loud as I read, and this book (especially the last quarter) got me. ⭐️ 4.75 I really loved this book , I just wish they gave it more ending.  3.5 stars rounded up to 4 for the rep. I loved this as a historical fiction piece and I loved the way it shined light on marginalized groups that have been almost entirely ignored by history, but the actual story itself was slow and not very compelling. I wish more time had been spent on the last 1/3 of the book, and that we were given more information on what happened to the characters and their lives together after the epilogue.   What a beautiful and local story of sexuality, love and racial identity. THRILLED to see this as YA novel. Just really cool and informative about lived experiences in SF in this era. Curious to learn more bc some of the timelines went above my head. this book has my entire heart ❤️❤️❤️ Over the backdrop of a richly illustrated 1950s San Francisco Chinatown, Lo brings readers a unique perspective of a pivotal moment in American history through the eyes of Lily, our young protagonist. Lily’s own personal story is one of curiosity and incredible courage, but also of all the uncertainty that comes with the unknown. This is one of the most beautiful depictions of sapphic love and self discovery that I have ever had the pleasure of reading, and for that reason, I struggled with writing a review that felt like it truly captured how much I loved this story and the importance of stories like this to young women and queer folks. Over the course of Lily’s story, Lo’s writing brought along a river of emotions; I was nostalgic for a time and place that wasn’t my own, while also eliciting very real memories and feelings of my own experience of coming into myself as a queer teenager. While there is so much for someone to unpack in this beautiful story, I think it’s best to leave you with this knowledge; you won’t regret reading this, you might just find you love it as much as I do.[One of my favorite excerpts, "What is Communism's greatest strength?" I loved the juxtaposition of the historical perspective against Lily’s own desire to know this forbidden part of herself, and not be alone in it."What is Communism's greatest strength?"The response was oddly provocative, even stirring: "Its secret appeal to the lust for power. Some people have a natural urge to dominate others in all things."And then, in italics on a separate line: "Communism invites them to try."She knew the pamphlet was presenting Communism as an immoral lust for power, but perversely, perhaps, she found this last warning inspirational. Four words seemed to rise up off the page in whispers: secret, lust, natural, try.She lay back against her pillow, letting the booklet fall on her chest so that it rose and fell with the motion of her breath.Tomorrow, she decided, she would invite Kath to go with her to Thrifty Drugs. She had to show her that novel.]  Really interesting insight into 1950s lesbian San Francisco. Lo has done a lot of research and put together this heart wrenching but lovely story of a queer, Asian American woman trying to find her way.Sequel pleaseeee!   crying. not actually. but it feels like someone tore open an old wound in my heart, which is arguably worse!this book. so atmospheric. so well-written. so interesting. so romantic. anyway, gonna go lament that i finished this book and won't be able to read it for the first time again  I thought this was an LGBTQ+ book???? Why are there so many straight scenes in it *4.5 i’m inconsolable nobody speak to me ever again 4,5 ⭐ dawno się tak bardzo nie wciągnąłem w żadną historię, po prostu wow??? była to książka typu gdzie czułem, że okropnie mi się spodoba, i ogromnie cieszę się że się nie zawiodłem 4.5 starstook me a while to get into it &amp; even then i don’t think i was necessarily hooked BUT oh how i wish i had a book like this growing up oh my goshoh my goshwowi would write something very deep and meaningful but all I have to say is wow my hopeless lesbian heart is crushedI need a hug now oh my gosheven though it took Lily and Kath two hundred and twenty pages to hold hands they are so sweet and perfect aaaahhhhh oh the injustice of that just-before-the-ending partaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh i need more lesbian books in my life  really very cute!! &amp; the setting is just, chef’s kiss (1950’s San Francisco lesbian scene… i want to go to there) 4.5 Questo romanzo è stato un sali e scendi di pensieri, emozioni e azioni contradditorie. Partiamo per gradi, vi va?Ci troviamo negli Stati Uniti d'America, durante i primi anni '50, e davanti a noi ci si presentano personaggə di origini cinesi; ma una persona in particolare coglie la nostra attenzione: Lily Hu.Una "perfetta" ragazza cinese di 16 anni, rispettosa, diligente ed educata: ma questo modello di persona non si adatta più al pensiero della protagonista; scoprendo nuove rivelazioni sul suo essere e su ciò che prova. È comprensibile, da una parte, capire alcuni attegiamenti delle persone che si approcciavano alle persone omosessuali; dall'altra - per un lettorə del XXI Secolo certi modi non vengono ben visti dalla maggior parte della popolazione mondiale. L'inizio della storia è partito davvero soft, cercando di illustrarci i costumi e le maniere della gente dell'epoca; piano piano ci si inoltra nella vita di Lily, delle sue abitudini e dei suoi amici. Questo sentore di diversità, di incompatibilità con i suoi coetanei fa emergere in Lily tanti dubbi e domande, soprattutto: è lei a essere sbagliata? Cosa penseranno di lei? Può davvero far finta di nulla? Pensieri leciti, per una ragazza nel pieno sviluppo, che non sa ancora cosa sia la maturità sessuale né la differenza tra l'amare un uomo - come dovrebbe - e amare una donna.Nel corso della storia ci affacciamo alla realtà di quel periodo: si accetta fino ad un certo punto, poi si deve pagare "gli errori" a caro prezzo; senza poter giustificare le proprie azioni, cercando di nascondere al meglio i propri peccati, al costo di rimetterci la propria felicità. Ringrazio Oscar Vault per avermi permesso di leggere questo libro in anteprima. È stata una lettura piacevole, istruttiva e che porterò nel cuore.  Last Night at the Telegraph Club is a riveting tale about coming of age and falling in love in the 1950s San Francisco. Through Lily Hu's lens and her romantic relationship with Kathleen Miller, this raw &amp; emotional story fleshes out the narratives of marginalised individuals in an authentic lens. What worked for me:+ Characterisation: I loved the characters, especially Lily &lt;3 As a STEM student, it's always really nice to read books with this type of character representation. Even though the book is written in 3rd person narrative, I found myself connecting pretty well with her backstories as well as her scientific ambitions! Similarly, I also found Kath a pretty interesting character. I think Kath's personality is closely framed from how Lily sees her. As of the chararacter development: Their slow-burn relationship was gradual but also rather justified and I also enjoyed reading about how Lily opened up about herself, despite all the potential pushbacks from her family &amp; the society. Because this is a character-driven novel, having a solid characterisation is essential. Last Night at the Telegraph Club definitely hit the mark with its diverse cast of characters, each of whom are fleshed out in many complex layers and with a lot of emotional nuance.+ Central themes: While this is primarily Lily's story of coming of age and falling in love, a lot of thought-provoking themes were explored. Examples include: societal expectations, political climate, and the concept of privilege &amp; marginalisation. In particular, I found the notion of societal expectations in the book really well done - it highlights the tension between where Lily's heart truly belongs vs what her family expects her to be (based on their cultural upbringing). + Historical + cultural context: I applaud Malinda Lo's ability to craft a historically accurate fiction of this calibre. I can tell that the background of the book is carefully researched from the relevant historical events to the cultural aspects within the community. Through this accurate portrayal, it feels like San Francisco in the 1950s was brought back to life when I was reading the book!What could be better:- Writing style: I'm fairly neutral with the writing style. I liked that I could easily engage into the timeline of the story. I think it strikes a good balance between having accurate historical details without info-dumping. But at the same time, I also think the writing style didn't give me sufficient leverage to penetrate fully into Lily's emotional headspace. I know that Lily had been through a lot emotionally throughout the course of the novel e.g. her ambitions and her journey of coming of age, gave great opportunities for her character development, but I personally wasn't that invested in the romance.- Pacing: My biggest issue is the pacing. I personally found the pacing a bit uneven throughout the book. While I didn't mind the flashback scenes as the backstories did a pretty good job exploring the central themes, I found the final 1/3 of the novel a bit rushed &amp; jumped around quite a bit. Nevertheless, I really appreciated that the romance is slow-burn (I'm glad because there are way too many insta-love romances out there). Despite the concerns that I've mentioned earlier, Last Night at the Telegraph Club is nevertheless a gripping character-driven novel with astounding historical accuracy, featuring a heartwrenching &amp; slow-burn queer relationship. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who's looking for a diverse read with strong characterisation and solid historical context.N.B. This book contains following triggering content: homophobia, xenophobia, racism, +full content warning list from(3.5 stars out of 5)  Omg. Literally so good. 4.95 ⭐️, rounded up where do i start with this book? the beginning half was slower for me, but gradually it became an easier, faster read.the ending wasn’t my favorite, i didn’t get as much closure as i had hoped, but there is apparently a companion novel out, so i am going to add it to my ‘to-read’ list immediately.otherwise, such a beautiful book, i always love representing all kinds of people, and it really spoke on love, self-discovery, relationships with friends and family, everything&lt;3 all that’s left is for someone to be the lily to my kath!!! pls  3 stars for the lesbians, but I really had no idea what was going on in this bookedit: *spoiler-ish*i wanted to come back to this to give it a better review, after spending time thinking about it and also recommending it to my friend + seeing people borrow it in and out of my library. i think this story was a lot less about a love story between lily and kath, and more an exploration of lily as a chinese person, living in san francisco chinatown, during the 1950s, post-chinese exclusion act and during the red scare. when i see it more as a survival story for lily, who as a young queer person of color is just trying to do so much more than exist but thrive, i realize that is lovely and miraculous in its own way. it was about friendship and family and what it means to keep a secret so fundamental to you, but finally finding that one person you can share it with. there was more to be seen with kath and lily, but the thing about liberation is that it is always just a taste upon our tongue; the real thing is out of this world unimaginable.   what if they were thinking of each other at the same time? 😭😭😭 eu quero gritar sei la 4.5 estrelas t amo Maybe even 4.5 stars. Great historical details! The setting felt super vivid to me. Easy 5. don’t know why i thought this was going to be just a cute romance book :’) Este tem sido daqueles livros que me regressam à memória com alguma frequência, parece que me assombra, mas nem por isso esta opinião foi mais fácil de escrever.“Ontem à Noite no Telegraph Club” tem um forte cunho histórico, mas nada de aborrecido, prometo! A escrita da Malinda Lo é muito acessível e como um todo a narrativa é bastante fluída e viciante, diria que há somente umas 100 páginas pelo meio do livro que poderiam beneficiar de um ritmo mais acelerado!A meu ver a história centra-se em dois grandes temas: a relação que a Lily tem com a sua família e a forma como a cultura chinesa que partilham impacta, não só essa relação, como a relação que ela tem consigo própria; e o processo de autodesoberta identitária da protagonista.Adorei a forma como estas duas temáticas se entrelaçaram, foi a minha característica favorita do livro.Muito do enredo permite-nos experienciar a cultura queer dos anos 50, não só acompanhamos o emergir de um romance sáfico que tem de ser vivido na penumbra, como grande parte da ação se passa num bar que é palco para a arte do transformismo. Nas idas de Lily ao Telegraph Club vimos nas ações e reações dela o reflexo dos valores que lhe foram incutidos, mas também, na forma como é tratada, o reflexo de uma sociedade profunda e intrinsecamente racista. Todo o enredo é imerso numa atmosfera de perigo e expectativa que, julgo eu, caracteriza muito bem o que seria ser uma mulher chinesa e gay nos E.U.A dos anos 50.Não sei que mais vos diga sem que vos estrague a expectativa de leitura, a jornada da Lily é uma história poderosa, emotiva, de tirar o fôlego… Durante umas páginas, mais para o final do livro, dei por mim a lacrimejar.  this book was amazing!!! go lesbians go!!!! i loved glimpsing parts of queer, more specifically lesbian, life in san francisco during the 50s’, especially how it untangled with being asian-american &amp; a daughter of immigrants living in chinatown. i learned a lot, and it’s infuriating to see how some things have not changed that much, even if it makes you wonder about then-queers, and how much, in the end, we all have in common.lily, as a character, was /very/ relatable and i hoped the very best for her after like 2 pages. her journey with accepting her sexuality and refusing to deny who she was felt spot on (and once again, relatable in many ways) which proves once again that we need stories about lesbian poc written by lesbian poc. the way she approaches her chinese inheritance and background, and how she wants to prove how much she belongs in america, is also very interesting and needed.her love story with kath was overflowing with chemistry and the purest love you can think of, and its development (especially the beginning for me, how they tiptoe around each other in fear and hope) was astonishing.this book talks about love, history, race, friendship, family and hope and i cannot think about anymore reasons you should read it !!!!! read it !!!!! do it !!!!!  5/5 - this book deserves all the praise and more. I wish I had taken more notes as I listened to share my favorite quotes, moments, and character pieces. This book is phenomenal. i wish i had words to describe how much i've fallen in love with this book and its characters but, as always when something like this happens, i'm mostly just a ball of !!!!!!at the same time, i could sit here for hours and completely exhaust the goodreads character limit listing WHY this book is great and WHY it will mean so much to so many people across so many backgrounds and WHY it's important and WHY it made me swoon and WHY it's practically flawless.i will try to be brief, though, and simply say that... this book has everything.the main character has so many odds stacked against her, and there's so much going on economically, culturally, socially - but it's done with so much care. not for a single second did i doubt that malinda lo was treating this character with the utmost respect. i absolutely adored the space lily was given to process and feel through everything at the beginning. the tension builds so delicately only to resolve in an epilogue that is perfectly fitting given the backdrop of the entire story.while it obviously includes period-typical homophobia and misogyny, and queerness is not met with acceptance, it creates a heart-shattering AND heart-warming space for queer asian-americans in (the us, in this case) history. it is affirming, and beautiful, and relatable. it's atmospheric and it played like a movie in my head while i was reading it. it captures the period &amp; the relationships in such a tangible way. as a reader, you ARE in 1954, you ARE in the telegraph club, you SMELL the booze and the cigarettes, you can SEE these gay women trying to make a place for themselves in this world that you now can also inhabit for a short amount of time. the scenes are picked out so carefully, and the right details are described, to create a full, whole picture of a moment in time when you're living in a country that seems to move by its own rules that try to erase you while trying to discover your true self and allow yourself to LOVE. and it HAPPENS.i just absolutely adored everything about this, and i'm SO HAPPY that this is my first five-star read of the year. it couldn't have been better.god. my heart. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3   Thoughts:A painful, beautiful, inclusive, emotional, and hopeful story. It is incredibly well-written with so much history. You can clearly see how much research was put into it. The timelines of what is happening in-between parts really kept you in full understanding of what was going on the entire story. We get just a glimpse into Chinese American and lesbian culture, but you walk away with so much understanding of what it would be like during this period. My heart was broken, but I also felt the love between two school girls who are just finding their way through a homophobic and racist world with the odds stacked against them. Every part of me ached for both Lily and Kath. The characters you are supposed to love you love. The characters you don't, you will not. However, there is a grey area with some characters that you are conflicted as to what to feel about. The telegraph club felt like a safe haven with lots of lesbian representation. A place where you felt free to be yourself and have a community of those who understand you. It was lovely to feel a part of it, and be brought into it. A warm but gut-wrenching sapphic story of discovering love and who you are. Thank you Malinda Lo for this magnificent book! Would I recommend this and to who: YES! As said by Emily X.R. Pan (on the cover), “This book is for anyone who has ever loved-in any sense of the word.” Paperback/Hardcover/Audiobook/E-book: E-book and audiobookHow did I discover this: A girl on hinge actually said it was her favorite and told me to give it a try lol.Pace: Medium-pacedCover thoughts: It is so pretty, and my favorite moment from the book.POV:MultiQuotes:“She’s having a hard time right now because you’re not what she expected. But we’re never what our parents expected. They have to learn that lesson.”“It’s unmistakable.” (How she could recognize Kath at the other end of a crowded Galileo hallway by the way she walked.) “It’s like . . . well, it’s like falling,” Lana said. “Falling, or floating, or sinking.” (Every time they kissed.) “You won’t know which way is up.” “It’s like having a fever.” (The way the world seemed to narrow down to the tips of Kath’s fingers.) “It’s like being drunk—drunk for days.”“She wondered if Kath could sense her, sitting on this train as it took her away. Perhaps it was possible, if she closed her eyes and sent out her thoughts along the steel track like a message along a telephone wire. I love you. I love you. The train swayed gently beneath her, and she leaned against the window to feel the cool glass against her cheek, and she was sure that Kath had heard her, she was sure.”Triggers: Homophobia, Racism, Xenophobia, Racial slurs, Miscarriage, Underage Drinking etc.  3.5Really enjoyed it and it definitely felt like a sweet love letter to butch and femme lesbians. I probably would have liked it more if I was younger and closer to the demographic this was written for, but the best compliment I could give it is “Stone Butch Blues for a younger audience.” Besides that, I’m always delighted to read books written by Asian authors and have Asian perspectives front and center. It’s always a refreshing experience for me, and I would say the focus on Lily’s Chinese heritage had a little bit more to do with my enjoyment of the book than her sexual attraction discovery. I think what I missed the most out on is the nuance of her heritage as it related to her self discovery, but that’s likely due to me being Filipino. My Fil-Chi exposure unfortunately didn’t quite carry me through all of her experiences, but was still familiar enough to enjoy a lot of the book. Overall very pleased - I basically bolted home after getting the book today to read it, as I had been waiting about half a week since I ordered it through my local store. Definitely left the last page fairly satisfied, and can blame my “wanting more” to the fact I am not a “young adult.” :)))   Second read: I love the world build by Malinda Lo. I love the way she captures the dynamics of a Chinese family. I love the way she writes the pressure Lily feels placed on her to be a “good Chinese girl” against the pressure of the truth building within her. This is the 5 star part for me. *sobs in 5 star*——————————I had to stop reading this and take a break at one point because I couldn't see the words through my tears. And I don't usually cry in a book.....  4.5 starsThis was one of my most anticipated releases for 2021 and it absolutely delivered on all fronts. A beautifully written tale of first love, self-worth, and discovering one's sexuality, this story follows Lily Hu, a young Chinese-American girl living in 1954 San Francisco as she begins to frequent the Telegraph Club.This first thing that struck me about this book is how well written it is. Switching between two timelines, Malinda Lo weaves together a captivating story about two generations of a family trying to find their place in American society. Lily begins the novel as a quiet, thoughtful girl who likes science and space. She gradually realises that she's attracted to women and, after her first visit to the Telegraph Club with Kath, begins to explore this further. The moments Lily and Kath share where they can be their true selves openly and without fear were some of my favourites in the novel. The pure, unadulterated joy I felt at seeing them let go and enjoy each other's company (romantically) was a heady rush.  The story puts racism and homophobia under the microscope and challenges the way people of the time considered queer people and immigrants. The negativity of Lily's family's reaction to her sexulity is countered by the soft moments between Lily and Kath. It's almost as though Malinda Lo is saying to us, how could there be anything 'wrong' or 'bad' about a love this pure? Immigration is discussed with such nuance that we get a sense of exactly how Lily and her parents feel about their status in the US. Their fear of being linked to Communist sympathisers and unfairly deported leads them to portray the image of a model family and encourage Lily to be a 'good Chinese girl'. This image weights heavily on Lily as she doesn't want to let her family down but also wants to be free to be herself. I listened to this on audio and the narration was sublime. There's an author's note at the end where the narrator describes the history of every part of the book (queer culture, clubs, San Francisco in the 1950s, the pressures on immigrants, the history of Chinese communities in America and more) and I was absolutely blown away by the amount of research that went into this novel.This book drew me in and captivated me completely. Lily Hu stole my heart and I loved this story so much.Trigger warnings for racism, xenophobia, homophobia, deportation, mentions of violence and police brutality, coming out rejection by parents, running away, underage drinking, mentions of a miscarriage, racial and queer slurs (connected to the era).  i loved this 🥺 review to come!  Let me begin by saying if I can give this book a 10/5 star rating, I will. Last Night at the Telegraph Club by Malindo Lo is a masterpiece. Midway through the book, Malindo Lo would sometimes put glimpses of the lives of other characters who influence the life of Lili. I didn't like it. I thought they were unnecessary. When I realize the purpose of those chapters, I started to love them, especially Aunt Judy's chapters. These chapters provide a glimpse of the kind of world Lili and Kath live in. With the struggles of the people before them, there are certain expectations along with it. What stands out the most about this book is how easy to read the chapters and scenes. Malindo Lo's prose seems like it is singing in every page. You can feel each cute moments, the heartbreaks, and those stolen moments with deep intimacy too. I cannot emphasize enough how I tried my best not to cry every time Lili and Kath struggled, but I had failed many times. I recommend listening to Reflection (especially the Christina Aguilera version) after reading this. Oh, Last Night at the Telegraph Club will shatter your heart and you'll love it.   Historical fiction set in 1950s Chinatown in San Francisco. It’s an adorable story about Lily, a 17 yo Chinese-American who, being gay, is trying to find her place in her own world and family. It’s adorable, but also heartbreaking at times. It’s a coming-of-age, but never boring. I have a lot of admiration for Lily and I loved the aunt. Totally recommend!  I adored this.The writing was exceptional and i loved the way certain problems (involving an asian lesbian, who is also a woman in stem in the 50s) got addressed, as well as historical aspects, which added to the conflicts!The only reasons why I’m not giving this 5 stars is, because I felt like the ending was rushed and there could’ve been some more scenes of lily and kath together, since I haven’t rlly felt much attachment to the ship.  4.5 starsA queer asian American coming of age story? Sign me the hell up!I've been excited about this book since I heard about it's release and it sure did not disappoint. Lily's story set in 1950s San Francisco is well done but hurts to read at times because it's the 50s and homophobia is omnipresent. So coming out is obviously difficult and while this is historical fiction, it did give off the appropriate vibes. And even as Lily struggles with her own sexual awakening and the reactions of her surroundings and family, she also has these glimmers of hope in queer bars she attends and is obviously way too young for. Age works a bit different though when you're young and queer, I'd say. She finds allies and help in certain folks. This is just a very good book! Please read it if you like cute teenage romance, queer girls, and history. I'm pretty sure you won't be disappointed.   This book was literally so good that I HAD to add it to my favorites. The historical fiction time period really came through in the work and I really felt that I had been transported to the 50s while reading. I also simply adored the sapphic romance, and thought that Lily's exploration of her sexuality was the most realistic one that I've ever read.Characters: 10/10Wow! The characters were all incredible and realistic. Especially Lily! I thought that Lily was an incredibly sweet girl that I related to. A lot of what she was going to and what she was thinking about resonated with me and made me think about my own life. I also loved Kathleen, and really enjoyed seeing an Italian main character since I feel like I don't see a lot of them! Additionally I really liked reading about Lily and Shirley's friendship even though it wasn't a good one. Their struggling friendship was very good to read and shows how some friendships don't last forever. Writing: 8/10The writing was overall pretty great and easy to read, however I thought that it could've been a bit more flowery. Personally I enjoy flowery writing in my historical fiction but this felt a bit more down to earth, which while wasn't bad isn't really what I look for in historical fiction. But of course, this is just my personal preference. Plot: 10/10There was never a dull moment the whole way through. There were a lot of side plots but I felt that all of them were interesting and deserved the page time they got. Setting: 10/10Malinda Lo did an amazing job bringing to life the 50s in China town by adding specific details and incorporating Chinese language and culture. Truthfully I felt that I'd been transported back in time!Ending: 8/10It was nice but I wished that was a bit different. No spoilers though.Romance: 10/10Lily and Kathleen are officially my favorite lesbian couple!! They are just so cute and pure!!Overall: This book was truly amazing and I'd suggest it to anyone looking for either a good LGBTQ+ novel or a good historical fiction one!  2.5 to 3 stars This book has a bunch of good reviews, but it was honestly kind of a let down for me. The book was much longer than it needed to be. I'm not sure why it was close to 400 pages when not much really happens. I also didn't understand the structure of the novel. To start off every section, Lo included a piece of a timeline and then a flashback from an older character (i.e. Lily's mother, father, or aunt). However, these things do nothing to add to the plot. The only thing the flashbacks did was make me want to know more about Lily's father and aunt, and I was disappointed when I didn't get more.Similar to the flashbacks that lead nowhere, there were several plot points that get introduced only to come to nothing. A storyline that I thought had good potential was about the Red Scare and its effects on Chinese Americans, but this storyline remains underdeveloped throughout the book. The book's back cover synopsis makes it seem like America's communist paranoia will play a bigger role in the narrative than it actually does. The novel is categorized as historical fiction, but the "historical" part falls somewhat flat for me personally. To justify the book's length, I think more time could have been spent on this part of the narrative. As for the love story, I can appreciate what the book tries to do. I like how it looks at an LGBTQ love story from a more diverse perspective, namely that of a Chinese American girl in the 1950s. Yet, I cannot help but think that it could've been better executed. The book is called "Last Night at the Telegraph Club," but it takes over 100 pages (1/4 of the novel) before they even go to the Telegraph Club. Too much build up! Also, I don't feel like we get to see Lily interact with her love interest all that much. I think that Lo could've delved more into their relationship than she did. I just wanted more than what we were given. That being said, it seems like the book did resonate with other people, and I think that's great because I know that we need more diverse stories and storytellers.   I was provided an ARC via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review.Set in San Francisco in the 50's, Last Night at the Telegraph Club tells Lily's story. Lily is 17 and lives in Chinatown with her brothers and parents. When her best friend, Shirley, shows her an ad in the paper, her eyes fly to another ad, one for a club, and specifically for a male impersonator, Tommy Andrews. Lily is fascinated and cannot get the ad, the club nor Tommy out of her head. And then she gets to know one of her classmates, Kathleen who's actually been to that club.This was so hard to rate. One the one hand, the writing was beautiful and I could tell that the author researched the time period so well, it was truly immersive, I felt like I was right there and then.One the other hand, it dragged. It took me several time to actually start the book and then, I had trouble staying awake to read it. There's just a lot of nothing happening, especially at the beginning. It takes a long time for the story to full on start and even after that, I still felt like it dragged on. And while the chapters about the parents and the aunt were super interesting on a historical level, I felt like they brought next to nothing plot-wise. Speaking of plot, the ending felt a bit rush and I feel like we had little closure... which was so frustrating considering how much the entire book dragged on.So yeah, basically, I have mixed feeling about it all and I still don't know how I feel about the use of some of the racial slurs. I know the author wrote in a note at the end of the book that it was how Black people and East Asians were called back then and she wanted to be as accurate as possible but it still felt unnecessary to me. But then again, I'm white and it's not my call to make.Just expect a lot of racism and homophobia.All in all, my advice would be for you to read this book for yourselves and tell me what you think!  "That book. It was about two women, and they fell in love with each other." And then Lily asked the question that had taken root in her, that was even now unfurling its leaves and demanding to be shown the sun: "Have you ever heard of such a thing?" - Malinda Lo, Last Night at the Telegraph ClubBeing queer comes with its obstacles. Just like being Chinese in America. This book set in San Francisco's Chinatown during the 1950s, combined both ingredients and baked a delicious historical fiction.The romance in the book is lovely and bittersweet. But what really hooked me was how sincere this book was about being Chinese. It's quite rare to find an ownvoice book that not only focuses on the second generation immigrants, but also the first generation immigrants and their struggles with their loyalty, identity, and responsibilities. This book was narrated from a multigenerational perspective and gave me an immersive time travelling experience. It featured Lily and her mum, who were born and raised in America. And her dad, who just wanted a temporary stay in America to pursue his degree, but couldn't go back anymore due to WWII and China's changing political climate. The book also comes with timelines that highlighted important political and personal dates that I really appreciated.My heart still hurts for the Chinese Exclusion Act, the discrimination my people faced (and are still facing today), the demonization and discrimination queer people faced (and are still facing today). The way Lily's parents talk about politics and their uncertainties are so recognizable and still applicable today. It's a historical fiction that has many parallel with the life marginalized groups are living in 2021.I would recommended for anyone looking for an intersectional read.(Especially if you liked Jane from One Last Stop, I really think this gives you additional understanding of what being Chinese meant back then, an aspect OLS failed to address)  Being a mood reader, I usually prefer standalones because they don't require a long commitment. Now I'm actually disappointed I won't get to read more about Lily and Kath and the girls at the Telegraph Club. I loved the whole book so much, and the author's note at the end (a summary of her research in writing the book) made the whole story more complete and interesting (note that I very usually loathe anything non-fiction).(I've never liked a YA historical fiction; if not at all, at least not that much.)CharactersASJKFHSDLLKSAJDPlot, Pacing, and MoodIs there a plot? I don't know, and I don't care to determine it. The characters did most of it for me, the main love relationship was just so purE and real, and I never lost interest in the events, so we're good to endorse.The pacing was good, the story got shaken when I didn't really expect it to, and we did get to suffer a little (I was an AO3 angst reader in my time, so this is always a plus).If there's one grudge I hold to this book is not tying up some (minimal) subplots e.g. What happened to Tommy and Lana, Jean, and Calvin and Shirley? Did Lily's father ever get his papers back?.Setting and WritingI've read some reviews that say Malinda Lo's writing is not enjoyable, but I have an entirely different opinion. I felt like I was touring San Francisco in the 1950s. The author did a lot of research (which she explains about it in her final note) but there wasn't any info dump and everything felt natural.Also, trust me, you want to read this book just for the food mentions and descriptions.If You Liked It, You Might Like- 
  The Girls at the Kingfisher Club
Why? It also revolves around secret/illegal nightlife. (Disclaimer: The plot and cultures aren't the same, and it's not an f/f book.)  A 3rd book in the span of two weeks?? Wow. Anyways, the ending of this book was so beautiful and I'm so emotional rn.It was very slow paced at first and there wasn't much to keep me so invested in the story that I'm dying to keep reading, but almost halfway through the story when Lily and Kath got together and you could see Lily's character development it became so interesting that I wanted to keep reading and couldn't put the book down (that and the fact that I'd do anything to avoid studying at this point lol). Like in most slow-paced books I've read, the last 200 or so pages were more action-packed than the first half of the book. However, I loved the realistic build-up to Lily's and Kath's relationship (realistic because given the circumstances in which the story takes place, it's got to be a slow build-up, if that makes sense). Also, I loved the way Lily's character was gradually developing and starting to stand up for herself against those who want to put her down (*cough* Shirley *cough*) and that once she knew she loves Kath, that she loves girls, she refused to back down and lie about her feelings and refused to feel ashamed about her love for girls. I also loved that even though everyone around her was against her because she's a lesbian, her little brother Eddie was so supportive of her, it just goes and shows that even though grown-ups usually say children are too young to understand these things and shouldn't be "exposed" to them, but they understand these things more than the grown-ups do and they're also more sympathetic and accepting (which is I guess what these boomers are afraid of) but anyways I loved that Eddie is the one who saved their relationship :'). And lastly, I absolutely adore the feminist undertones as well in the characters of Lily, Kath, and Aunt Judy being female scientists and them having big parts in huge scientific developments. Sorry for the long review, but this book was just *chef's kiss*  4.5* rounded upMore thoughts to come, but this was a lovely coming-of-age historical fiction novel featuring a queer Asian American teenage girl falling in love in 1950s America. The concept alone makes this a unique, special read.--Thanks to @netgalley for the digital ARC and @penguinteen for the hardcover of LAST NIGHT AT THE TELEGRAPH CLUB! #PenguinTeenPartnerMalinda Lo’s LAST NIGHT AT THE TELEGRAPH CLUB is a lovely, tender coming-of-age queer novel about 17-year-old Lily Hu falling for her classmate Kath in 1950s San Francisco Chinatown.I’ve never read YA historical fiction featuring a queer Asian American girl, which makes this a special read for me. Also, Lo covers an ambitious scope with the 1950s backdrop- when being gay was not culturally acceptable and homosexuality thought of as a psychotic disorder, the effects of McCarthyism on Chinese Americans, and being Asian in predominantly white spaces, like the Telegraph Club’s lesbian bar.The flashbacks provide historical context and thought those parts would dramatically convey the looming threat of deportation, with Lily’s father’s suspected Communist ties and, therefore, the need to maintain the status quo and look more “American.” But LAST NIGHT is at its most compelling in the way Lo writes Lily’s self-discovery and desire, balancing multiple identities (what’s expected of Lily with her family and friends in Chinatown vs. being with Kath and the women she meets at the Telegraph Club), and her budding romance with Kath.I LOVED the Author’s Note about Lo’s personal connection, extensive research and careful consideration when writing about this time in history, including a select bibliography of sources.Lo writes how difficult it was finding histories of queer Asian American women. This novel gives voices to those whose stories have been erased.  You ever read a book and think... everything about this feels familiar? That's exactly how I felt while reading Last Night at the Telegraph Club, despite the fact that this took place in San Francisco and in the 50s (!!!) but the descriptions of Lily's home life and family dynamic, the way Lily reacted to certain things, the things she had to consider to keep up this image of the good Chinese daughter and to protect the reputation and safety of her family... it was everything I knew, everything I've experienced. Lily is way more daring than I would ever be but I respected her for it - it was incredible to see her grow into her own. Reading about real Asian American history so intricately and expertly weaved into every chapter was so interesting and eye-opening. I just want to learn more about it all and deeply appreciated the Author's Note in which Malinda provided a great overview on the meticulous research that went into making this story historically accurate/believable.I wish I read this story in high school but hey I'm not THAT different from who I was in high school so I'm lucky to have read this book now. Books like these represent the best of YA. I was pleasantly surprised to see traditional Chinese characters as well and tried my best to figure out how to say it even though I don't speak Canto and I am very close to illiterate in Chinese without pinyin or bopomofo. I don't think I've ever seen Chinese characters -period- in a YA novel or any novel for that matter that wasn't my old Chinese school textbook. I bought this book after hearing about the premise alone and wow, I was not disappointed. I wish we explored a little more about the Red Scare in the U.S. and how every Chinese American was accused of being a Communist and threatened with deportation because welp, history sure loves to repeat itself, doesn't it...  one of the best books i’ve read this year, love it so much! TL;DR: it was objectively a good book, yet it failed to leave an impression to me because the characters felt a little flat. the story was interesting; the characters not so much.The whole review: i would divide this book in two parts. on one hand, it's a lesbian coming of age story, on the other, it's a historical fiction about chinese-american immigrants during the 50s, in the context of the red scare about communism. it's an interesting mix, and it managed to be compelling and interesting. the historical aspect was immersive, and it touched on world war 2 and it's socio-political impacts on the chinese communities. it also centers around the struggles of queer communities in the 50s.the coming of age aspect of the story is certainly relatable and charming, and i think it displays a lot of common feelings and thoughts of lesbian girlsthe romance aspect of the story, however, sort of felt flat to me. it certainly wasn't bad, and it had some cute moments, but it didn't particularly stand out. i would say this book is more story-driven rather than character-driven (at least to me, none of the characters really stood out). so i think you should keep that in mind if what you're looking for is a sapphic romance. i wouldn't say that's the selling point of the book.i do think, however, that this book has some value in terms of historical queer content. so if you're interested in reading about queer history, i'd say you'd check this one outoverall, i enjoyed it. i had to take a point because it dragged on during the second half of the book, and it became tedious to read, and the ending felt like it left some parts of the plot unresolved or unmentioned, but it wasn't a bad story. it has a realistic and down to earth narration, and it feels rather mature for its genre (i was surprised to find it was YA). so i wouldn't discourage anyone from checking it out.  I will fully admit that I bought a physical copy of this book and the audiobook without knowing anything about it. Tell me it's a sapphic historical fiction and I am in. Anyway, this is set in the 50s in San Francisco and it's about a 17-year-old Chinese girl discovering her sexuality. Lily is Chinese and there are a lot of cultural expectations within her family that play into all of her experiences. When Lily sees an ad for the telegraph Club showcasing a male impersonator, she knows she has to find a way to get there. When she finds out that her new friend Kath has been to the telegraph Club, they end up going together.I really loved seeing Lily's perspective on everything that she was seeing and hearing for the very first time and finally kind of coming to grips that the way that she feels is okay. It's really world shifting to realize that you're not alone in your experience and Malinda Lo does a great job at guiding readers through Lily's thoughts about her experience.The one part of this book that I didn't quite understand were the alternate perspectives and timelines. I feel like maybe they were there just to give us some context about Lily's parents and family but they felt unnecessary to me and it would have rather had more time spent with Lily and Kath.This book does use time appropriate language which the author does a whole spiel at the end about why certain language and themes were used and that was really important I think to have that context as a reader. It does mean that there are a lot of homophobic and racist slurs that are 100% not appropriate today but would have been casual language in the 50s. Content warning for a lot of homophobian racism and if that's not something that you feel capable of reading right now that is totally okay, maybe throw this on the back burner for right now.Chinese lesbian MC  Oh this was delightful. Lo really digs into the geography of 1950s San Francisco and manages to make the obvious research she did (and what she writes about doing at the end) a core part of the book without it really being an Obvious Infodump? This is just such a book rooted beautifully, beautifully in place and I love it for that. She just does a great job of constructing the world and guiding you through it. Lily feels so real and has such complex feelings and I love to see her get to develop a community and be mentored to some small extent even by older queer people. The tension also of being both Chinese American and gay is really explored in a way that doesn't feel like you're being hit over the head with like Belonging Only Partly in Two Different Worlds But Never Wholly By Either; the racism by white queer people in the book feels very matter of fact and although we (and Lily) cringe at it, and it's clear it's Wrong and tokenizing, it also feels... period appropriate (and obviously of course there is ongoing anti-Asian racism in white queer circles that has to be addressed, but its form has transformed somewhat.) The end feels like a balance of kind of predictable but also nice. I would like to see if we could do this balance that doesn't require a family coming out, just because that's My Shit (not having to draw on current narratives about coming out etc.) Overall, a really lovely book that I enjoyed very much. It never felt slow or particularly contrived, and I really recommend it!   4.5 ⭐ *chef's kiss* “An unfamiliar emotion swelled inside her at this image. A strangely sharp pang for a place she had never visited. For a people she resembled but did not know.”Un historical fiction moderno che approfondisce una pagina della storia americana forse non troppo conosciuta.Il romanzo è ambientato nella Chinatown di San Francisco nel 1954, nel bel mezzo della "Paura Rossa" ("Red Scare") - il periodo di intenso anticomunismo che ebbe luogo negli Stati Uniti durante i primi anni cinquanta. Un periodo caratterizzato dalla diffusione di un'estrema paura dell'influenza di comunisti e anarchici sulla società statunitense e della loro infiltrazione nel governo che portò a carcerazioni, persecuzioni politiche, investigazioni aggressive e violazioni dei diritti civili.Ed è proprio in questa cornice che viene raccontata la storia di Lily e Kat: un amore timido e un coraggioso percorso di scoperta e accettazione della loro omosessualità nonostante il clima di forte pregiudizio, violenza e paura. Sono rimasta molto colpita dall'ambizioso lavoro di ricerca svolto dall'autrice, che ha reso il romanzo molto preciso a livello storico e ben contestualizzato. La prosa è vivida e ricca di atmosfera: la modernità americana si mescola con la tradizione e la rigidità della Repubblica Popolare Cinese del tempo creando un setting davvero particolare.  Lily Hu is an American-born Chinese teenager, living in 1950s San Francisco Chinatown. Most in her community strive to show the nation that they are not a threat to American democracy, despite the communist revolution taking place an ocean away. Lily knows the expected path forward: stay in line, be a good Chinese girl, get married and have children. But instead, Lily finds herself intrigued by the possibilities offered in small nightclubs, where women dress and perform as men for gawking tourists as well as an underground community of gay women. Lily begins a cautious entry into this world, first sparked by a friendship with Kath, a fellow math scholar who recognizes something yearning in Lily. Kath and Lily slowly expose their true selves with each other, and meet older, freer women at the Telegraph Club, inspiring Lily to expand the narrow boundaries of her life.This book absolutely gleams. The imagery of San Francisco - fog cloaking the girls' illicit nighttime outings, street lights reflected in a lover's eyes, a trip to the planetarium bringing the bright contrasts of the moon's surface to an enormous scale... wow. I would love to see a talented movie director take this story on! A breathtakingly beautiful portrait of a young woman on the cusp of understanding who she is in the world. Recommended for older teens and adults.  "Last Night at the Telegraph Club" is an excellent novel that hits a lot of bases. It is first and foremost a coming of age novel that explores the electric feelings of first love. It also explores the experiences of Chinese Americans during the 1950's, the Red Scare, anti-Chinese racism, and the Lavender scare. It is a beautiful book that is well researched and written with so much love.The bulk of this novel focuses on Lily as she grows into the woman she was meant to be. Her relationship with Kath is front and center in this novel. Lo's depiction of first love is so on the money it is heartbreaking. Their interactions together and affection for each other feels real and heartfelt.The bulk of this novel is paced slowly so the reader can take their time getting to know the large cast of characters and their backstories. The problems faced by the Chinese community and the sapphic community are addressed in entirety so you have a clear idea of the stakes faced by Lily and Kath.Lo builds and builds on the tension in this story so that when the other shoe drops and all the foreshadowing came to a head my heart was pounding. I felt this pacing was incredibly appropriate for the type of story Lo is trying to tell. This is a beautiful novel with so many facets and dimensions to ponder. I spend the last two hours of this book in tears.   Last Night at the Telegraph Club was really good. It’s an amazing book and I enjoyed it, however my personal rating is probably more like a 3.5, simply because it’s not the kind of thing i’ll think about for a very long time, and it didn’t necessarily draw me in as much as I expected it to. Certain aspects, like the whole storyline surrounding communism (especially with a particular secondary character), got kind of ignored in the last part of the book, and a few plot details felt a bit underdeveloped. That being said, I highly recommend it, not only because the characters are really endearing and well-written, but it’s also quite interesting from a historical pov, and the author managed to weave some really educational material into the story without it ever seeming like an info dump. Also intersectionality!! POC lesbian rep!! So yeah, objectively, this is great, but I just didn’t enjoy quite it as much as I expected to.TW for homophobia and racism (mostly microaggressions)EDIT : changing my review to 4 stars cause i’m still thinking about this book months later and i also keep recommending it to people so i feel like that says a lot  Every queer person has a moment in their lives where the full meaning of Pride becomes real; this book was that moment for me. I can't even put my finger on what exactly it was that made the timeline of queer history suddenly suddenly and starkly apparent in all its pain and secrecy, but I've been thinking about it ever since. Next pride, this book is coming with me...This story is one that I've always wanted to read. Yes, for the beautiful intersectionality and historical perspective, but also because the experiences of average civilians in the midst of a global conflict is wildly underutilized in storytelling. We've read/seen the "normal person becomes an icon and a leader" a thousand times - I've always wanted to read about the Lily's. The ones who aren't on the front lines and who, for all intents and purposes, have nothing at all to do with the Big Horrible Thing but still suffer the consequences of it in real time. This book was amazingly incredibly remarkable. I genuinely can't say enough good about it.  It hurts to read this book because of how realistic the interactions between members of the Chinese community as well as how Chinese people were viewed back in the 1950s are. Even though at its core is a love story, I think the author does an excellent job of portraying the very real fear of deportation that Asian immigrants families faced during the "Red Scare" era.I would have liked to see a little more development of the romance and less of the viewpoints of the mom and the aunt. They just felt like a way to make more commentary about the 1930s, rather than anything that actually adds to the current story.Nevertheless, I highly recommend this book to anyone hoping to understand more about the LGBT and/or the Asian American plight.  This novel brims with emotion, shifting effortlessly from the highest highs of love and hope to moments of profound sadness and confusion. While the novel focuses on Lily and Kath, Lo effortlessly brings life to her friends and family, and the novel is just as much about Lily's growing awareness of her sexuality and how it impacts her family and community, as it is about her community itself, and what it means to be a minority in America. The short segments told from the perspective of Lily's family bring depth to not only those characters, but their own struggles and how it impacts their view of their family, community, and Lily herself. As the novel barrels towards its (in many ways inevitable) conclusion, I felt that Lo puts into words what, in many ways, is indescribable for young queers: The desire for identity and validation, even if they struggle to figure out what that identity truly is. A definite recommendation.  A coming of age story about a Chinese-American queer teen learning to embrace the different parts of her identity in 1950s San Francisco… There’s so much here. While it’s definitely a fun queer YA romance, the parts that grabbed me the most had to do with her Chinese-American identity, and the subtle (and not subtle) prejudices she encounters both in her daily life and within the predominantly white queer community she finds. Plus, the threat of deportation under the Red Scare, despite her family being citizens, loomed throughout the book, and I was constantly thinking ahead to how her actions might have serious repercussions for her family. In addition to pining for San Francisco (what a star!), the book left me thinking about so many things: Do we ever let go of our first loves? What does family mean? What does American mean? When do the definitions change? What do we owe our friends? When do we let go?  Exactly what I needed in this moment, an authentic, beautifully written, accurately represented, queer story by an own voices author. Last Night at the Telegraph Club delivered all that and more. Y’all know I get lazy with my reviews for a billion reasons but seriously, Adri’s review is brilliant! It articulates the strengths and beauty of this book so thoroughly and eloquently, I refer you to his, not just out of laziness but because it does this book the justice it deserves in a way I never could. The only thing I would add is that while I loved the story and the romance, I would have enjoyed it just a wee bit more if we’d have gotten more time with Lily and Kath and their budding romance. The way it’s written makes all the sense given the time period and the danger but I wanted more anyway. 4.25 stars. I borrowed this one from the library.  The sublime beauty of Highsmith’s “Carol” imprinted an automatic interest in reading about gay/queer women in the 1950’s for me and this book, while not reaching the perfection of “Carol,” also does not disappoint. It is a lovely coming of age story that tackles sexuality, xenophobia, and racism in tightly woven narrative that is utterly absorbing. One feels as if one is there with the main character, walking through the fog of the city, experiencing the vibrancy of Chinatown, the allure and mystery of the gay district. Lo captures San Francisco, along with the joy and terror that accompany discovering and accepting one’s sexuality, perfectly. This is an excellent addition to queer, YA literature and more importantly, a needed voice and story featuring a Chinese-American lesbian protagonist.  I sat down and started this book with no intention of inhaling it in a matter of hours, but that's precisely what happened. I was completely engrossed in Lily's life, taking place in San Francisco's Chinatown, 1954. Lily tries her best to be what her mother considers a "good Chinese girl", but her family doesn't know about her midnight trips to the Telegraph Club, a lesbian bar-- nor do they know about her growing feelings for her new friend, Kath. Last Night at the Telegraph Club is a stunning, beautiful novel of young, flourishing gay identity with support from LGBT elders, something we aren't all fortunate enough to have to show that there is a joyous life waiting beyond the confines of the closet.  i had such a good time reading this.this is a historical lesbian romance and i have no complaints about the romance, literally so cute and perfectly paced.each character seemed so real and had real personalities, unlike other books where the characters are so bland and dry like cardboard. i really loved the main character lily and felt connected to her, like i was there going through the same situations.i just wish the ending wasnt so rushed and also, some parts of the book seemed so out of place. we are told lily's dad might get deported but then nothing happens and the author just doesn't really mention it again in depth but i guess the main focus was the romance so i wasnt mad that it wasnt talked about a lot.all in all i loved this book so much and i recommend it♡♡♡  I don't know if I would've read this book if not for the Sapphic Reading Challenge ("Character of a different ethnicity, culture, or race than you" category!) and the fact the audiobook was narrated by Emily Woo Zeller. My main worry was that I saw it marketed everywhere as YA, and I have a bias against that genre (I know I'm in the wrong here, it's just personal preference) but it honestly never felt YA to me. Yes, the main character is 17, but that shouldn't automatically make it a novel for teens. I'm glad I gave it a shot, and I'll most likely give Malinda Lo another chance down the road because of it.  Wow. Such a well written, intersectional book, I’ve never read a young adult book like it EVER. It does such justice to queer Asian American women, and historic San Francisco, and — well I guess as a queer Asian American woman myself I wish I had had this book as a teenager. We do not live stunted lives because we don’t live like the status quo, such a misconception that angers me, and the tension of having to make your family proud— but also having individuals in your family who look out for you, and your chosen family— this book ties everything together so well. In fact I’m going to go to Chinatown and North Beach right now.   Thanks Penguin Teen and NetGalley for both the digital ARC and finished physical copy. This has not influenced my review one way or the other.While I don't tend to read a lot of historical YA or even YA romance, I really loved this book. Last Night at the Telegraph Club is a love letter to San Francisco, a cautionary tale about xenophobia and homophobia, a young woman's coming of age, and more. I thought Lo did a great job weaving in historical elements by showing instead of telling, and Lily's character development as she navigates friendships, family, and love felt very organic and rich.  Really enjoyed this one! Lo does a great job of introducing you to the culture of 50s Chinatown in San Francisco as well as the culture of underground queer clubs in a way that you can absolutely understand what's happening and what things are big deals, while not dragging the book down with long infodumps. It's a tough balance! And Lily and Kath are an adorable couple to root for. Mild spoiler:I appreciate also that this conveys the serious societal risks LGBTQ+ folks faced in the 50s while also showing the potential for happy endings  I loved this sprawling, heartfelt book. The characters are relatable and interesting. The glimpse into pre-Stonewall San Francisco dyke culture was really interesting, as was the window into American-born Chinese experience. I was drawn in from the beginning and never really took a breath until the end. There is much here that is universal queer coming of age stuff but it's informed and enlarged by the setting. The author's note is fascinating as well. Knocked down one star for the occasional, oddly inserted timelines that served to confuse more than elucidate. Highly recommended.  Holy smolie, this book was a rideeee. I loved it so much and the ending made me cry a bit (which isn’t really saying much bc I’m emotionally unstable) The descriptions made me really feel like I was in the 1950s and I loved the first half of the book where lilys trying to discover herself but it’s hard with Shirley. The only reason it’s not a full 5 stars is because I didn’t like the flashbacks a few years ago to her parents and aunt Judy, don’t get me wrong, they were very cute, but I didn’t see how they helped the story. Altogether I loved this book and highly recommended  I love everything about this beautiful story!!!I’m so in love with this beautiful and heartfelt story because it gave me a vivid snapshot of what Chinatown, San Francisco was really like and I felt as though I was experiencing every moment with Lily. I really wished this book was around when I was a teenager because I could totally relate to the tough choices Lily had to make. I’m anxiously awaiting this author’s next story because I can’t wait to see what she does next!   4.5/5 stars! This book encompasses you and instantly transports you to the 1940s and 50s. Seriously, this setting is as much of a character as the main cast is and I loved it. My sweet babies Lily and Kath really learned some lessons throughout this book huh? The only reason this is 4.5/5 and not 5 is solely because I felt like the conflict got introduced too late and thus squeezed into the last 70 pages. What can I say, I'm a sucker for angst.  characters written by women are always ten times better. i love how this book combines the struggles of being a chinese immigrant AND a lesbian in the 1950's. the author did a lot of research to make the book feel and be as real as possible and you can feel that while reading. its definitely a heartwarming book, but i wasnt a big fan of the ending. it seemed a little rushed and unfinished (not in the cliffhanger way).   Even though this wasn't the most enjoyable book to read at times, it was undoubtedly great. The amount of care Malinda Lo puts into building up 1950's San Francisco, particularly Chinatown, is amazing. The perspective of a young Chinese-American lesbian growing into her own during the red scare is a perspective that I hadn't realised was so lacking until I read this book. All of the historical and cultural stuff was great, with a very soft romance between Lily and Kath on top. Simply stellar!  4.5 starsJSBEJFB AAAAH the ending!!I’m not normally a romance reader, but Lo writes such vivid descriptions of what it must have been like to be a queer Chinese-American woman in the 1950s. The writing is evocative and Lo (with agonizing accuracy) describes the push and pull from different identity groups that embrace you and deny you at the same time. Belonging can be complicated and this book explores that very well.ps. yes this cured my fiction rut  I liked this a lot! Malinda Lo weaves a lot together–the Chinese American community in 1950s San Francisco, the Red Scare, the space race, the butch-femme lesbian bar scene, coming-of-age, and romance–in a really immersive way. Plus, the author's at the end note about research and influences was really interesting.  3.5* you know i liked this book a lot but something just kinda felt off most of the time i was reading it but like i still like it if that makes sense?? idk read it don’t read it, i think you will like it a lot more than me if you enjoy malinda lo’s writing style which i was willing to look past SINCE ITS GAY HISTORICAL FICTION anyways read the preview first see if you like it   This book was excellent and impressive. So well researched and kind of epic in its scale. It was amazing to discuss this book with readers! Lily is such a great protagonist and I was rooting for the the entire time. Highly recommend this book for HS readers and adults who enjoy historical fiction and or love stories.   i expected this book to be a romance novel and like as a romance novel it was ,, meh. 5/10. HOWEVER as a coming of age story / historical piece it was absolutely stunning. loved it. this was really about the main character figuring out her identity in the context of 1950s san francisco. and it was so good.   This book was SO GOOD oh my God. Kath and Lily are the only boomers I’ll ever sympathize with I s2g. This novel was life altering, man. The perspective on how queer people were treated, and not only that, but how just because someone was queer didn’t mean they didn’t have any biases of their own. The writing was stunning, and I can see several rereads in the future.   oh. my. god. i loved this book sm.lily’s journey in discovering who she is was amazing. the writing in this book is phenomenal i loved it sm. the historic setting was sm fun to read about. all the characters in this book are really well written. the way they act is very realistic. whenever food was mentioned my mouth immediately started watering. ahhh this book was soooo good!!  Crazy. Like how is it just going to end with that? It gave me nothing. Overall though, it had me in a chokehold. I really wish we got to see more of what happened after Lily left Chinatown to live with her Aunt and Uncle. I also would DIE for another book where Kath and Lily are a couple as young adults facing challenges that would arise from being lesbians in the 1960s. „Last Night at the Telegraph Club“ von Malinda Lo erzählt die Geschichte der 17jährigen Lily Hu, die sich in ihrem letzten Highschool-Jahr auf eine Reise zu sich selbst begibt und für ihre Liebe kämpfen muss. Erschienen ist der Roman bei Dutton Books im Januar 2021. Auf deutsch wird dieser Roman bei dtv im April 2023 erscheinen. San Francisco, 1954: Für die 17jährige Lily Hu beginnt ihr letztes Schuljahr. Eine Reise zu sich selbst wurde ihr von Miss Weiland versprochen und auf sie trifft das in besonderem Maße zu. Als sie Kath Miller näher kennenlernt, entsteht eine enge Freundschaft und Lily versucht sich aus der Enge Chinatowns zu lösen. Gemeinsam besuchen die beiden Mädchen heimlich den Telegraph Club, eine Bar in der sich Lesben treffen, und tauchen in eine vollkommen neue Welt ein. Fasziniert von den Darbietungen und Gästen stellt Lily fest, dass es mehr als Freundschaft sein könnte, was sie für Kath empfindet. Doch das Amerika der 50er Jahre hat keinen Platz für zwei sich liebende Mädchen, erst recht nicht, wenn eines davon aus Chinatown stammt, in dem noch mal andere Regeln gelten und Fehlverhalten sogar zur Abschiebung aus Amerika führen könnte. Coming of Age-Geschichten sind eigentlich nicht meins und dennoch hat mich der Klappentext irgendwie angesprochen. Eine lesbische Liebesgeschichte im Jahr 1954, wo doch die 50er Jahre in unseren Köpfen mit konservativen Rollenbildern verknüpft sind: Der Mann verdient das Geld, die Frau ist brav zu Hause, macht den Haushalt und kümmert sich um die Kinder. In diesem Kontext wirkt eine Bar, in der sich Lesben treffen, geradezu skandalös. Histolicious hat auf Twitter von diesem Buch geschwärmt und da war für mich klar, ich muss dem Buch eine Chance geben und was soll ich sagen, es hat sich in diesem Fall gelohnt. Das Buch ist gut geschrieben. Ich konnte mir alle Orte wunderbar vorstellen und die junge Lily und ihre Beobachtungen der Welt haben mir sehr gefallen. Sie beobachtet sehr genau und versucht auch die subtilen Botschaften einer Szene in sich aufzunehmen. Die Geschichte wird größtenteils aus Lilys Sicht erzählt und spielt im Jahr 1954. Allerdings gibt es auch Zeitsprünge in die Vergangenheit und kurze Kapitel aus der Sicht ihrer Eltern sowie ihrer Tante, die deren Geschichte ein wenig beleuchten. Zeittafeln vor jedem Abschnitt beleuchten die historischen Gegebenheiten und runden das Bild ab. Mir hat diese Kombination wahnsinnig gut gefallen. Vordergründig ist es die Geschichte von Lily und Kath, durch die Hintergründe lernen wir zusätzlich etwas darüber, warum die Menschen in Lilys Umfeld so reagieren, wie sie reagieren und es gibt einen historischen Einblick in jene Zeit und die damit verbunden Herausforderungen, was im Falle der Familie Hu bedeutet, dass ihnen die Abschiebung droht. Gleichzeitig gibt dieses Buch einen Einblick in die lesbische Szene jener Zeit. Lily sticht hier nochmal mehr heraus, weil sie chinesisch-amerikanisch ist. Ich mochte die subtile Art, wie sie ihr Umfeld beobachtet und daraus Erkenntnisse für sich selbst zieht. Ich habe mit ihr mitgefühlt, ich war selber wieder ein wenig 17Jahre alt und in einer Zeit, in der man viele neue Dinge ausprobiert und auch mal etwas Verbotenes macht. Eine Zeit, in der alles irgendwie neu und spannend ist. Mir war durchaus auch vorher klar, dass Repräsentation wichtig ist, aber dieses Buch hat mir das nochmal in einer besonderen Deutlichkeit vor Augen geführt. Das betrifft nicht nur ihr lesbisch sein, sondern auch Rassismus und Mikroagressionen im Alltag. Lily und Kath zusammen habe ich geliebt. Ihre Art miteinander umzugehen und sich an ihre Gefühle ranzutasten. Die Freundschaft, die bei den beiden entsteht. Die beiden haben wirklich sehr schöne Szenen miteinander und ich liebe es, dass dieses Buch den beiden, diesen Raum gegeben hat. Ich bin an sich kein Fan von Liebesgeschichten. Ab und zu kann ich das haben, aber danach habe ich meist für längere Zeit wieder genug, weil es mir oftmals zu viel Drama ist. Diese Liebesgeschichte hier empfand ich komplett anders. Es gibt auch Drama, aber eben erst zum Schluss und ich hatte viel Zeit einfach nur die Interaktionen der beiden zu genießen. In Sachen Repräsentation habe ich das Gefühl, dass dies hier ein wirklich sehr schönes Buch ist. Es ist ein Own Voice-Roman. Die Autorin ist lesbisch und chinesisch amerikanisch. In einem ausführlichen Nachwort, legt sie nochmal die historischen Gegebenheiten dar und warum sie sich für bestimmte Dinge entschieden hat, was mir sehr gut gefallen hat und was einiges für mich nachvollziehbarer gemacht hat. Dieser Roman ist wirklich sehr gut recherchiert und hat die Themen dieser Zeit wunderbar eingefangen. Es geht um die lesbische Szene, die chinesisch-amerikanische Gesellschaft und die Angst vorm Kommunismus in Amerika in jener Zeit. Ich würde gerne noch viel mehr schreiben, weil mir dieses Buch einfach so viel gegeben hat, aber ich denke, dass würde dann zu viel von der Geschichte vorweg nehmen. Fazit: Ein absolutes Highlight für mich und eine ganz große Empfehlung von mir, dieses Buch zu lesen. Ich habe diese Geschichte von Anfang bis Ende genossen, ich habe Lily und Kath geliebt und ich mochte die besondere Mischung aus Coming of Age-Geschichte und Historie, die mir das Amerika der 50er Jahre und seine lesbische Szene sowie die historischen Herausforderungen näher gebracht haben.  I don't think I've ever read anything about a queer Asian American girl in the 1950s before; I can't overstate how important it is that this book shows the history of people like us who were always here. Having this book as a young teen would have changed my life.  This book deserves so many more stars than five. What an absolutely beautiful story. Gorgeous, heartfelt writing. Meticulous research. The loveliest of queer romances. A trifecta of awesome! I've wanted to read this ever since reading the short in ALL OUT, and wow, does this deliver.  Last Night at the Telegraph Club gets all of the stars!!! The historical setting and accompanying events proved to be an extremely fascinating backdrop. My heart ached for Lily and Kath. I am desperate for a movie adaptation. Really enjoyed it. Loved the multiple point of view. Loved having the historical context but still a very cute love story. Makes me appreciate living in 2021. We love some gals who love STEM even through I think Mars is dumb.  absolutely loved this (except for the excessive smoking and drinking) right up until I read the word "epilogue" and was like uhhh sir where is the rest of my book, literally name one (1) thing that has been resolved here This cover... period. So excited for this.  4.5 *5 stars*I loved this book. Seriously, read it.Side note: I've seen this book described as 'slow', but I would see it rather as character-driven over plot-driven.  this was phenomenal   "This immersive, powerful coming-of-age novel tackles perceptions, expectations, and identity while sweeping readers into smoky lesbian nightclubs and ’50s culture.” —BCCB, starred review Best book I've read in a long time the book of my DREAMS!!!!!!! well-researched histories and a clear labor of love from Lo :') THAT ENDING BROKE ME. 4.5*Too lazy to write review10/10 would recommend though a SOLID 4.5 stars ✨ Beautifully written, the kind of book that sucks you entirely into the world the author has created. This will be one that stays with me! This book is so beautiful it had me feeling every emotion under the sun.  WAHHH super good... managed to be honest about the time period and stuff while also being hopeful.. love i need more, please give me more  wow. this book is everything for the lesbian community. i'm so in love. LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED IT  the most boring book i’ve read in a long time. oh man. oh man incredible book, but the emotional whiplash of the last 50ish pages was something else I mightttttt have read basically all this of this book in one sitting Just my thoughts - what is not to like about this book. brb gonna go take a bath with my toaster now 😂🔫this caused me sm emotional damage i need 3 - forever business days to process this. lesbian space girls got me bad i fear  a-ma-zing 5/5 ⭐️good lord i’m sobbing, gorgeous book, will reread ripped my heart into a million tiny pieces so so so so good  gay, sad 3.5 3,5 3,5 ⭐️ Pur non avendomi fatto impazzire, al contrario della maggioranza di persone che l’ha amato, ho apprezzato molto questo historical fiction nel suo differenziarsi da tutti gli altri young adult mainstream, poiché parla di una storia di due comunità (lesbica e cinese) da sempre taciuta, e ha ottenuto un successo nazionale che, a questo punto, tutto sommato capisco perché lo abbia avuto ;)Io da amante dei romanzi di formazione quale questo è in questo sotto-genere letterario, non poteva non piacermi, soprattutto la formazione stessa della protagonista Sebbene, devo ammettere, mi aspettavo un po’ più di emotività dalla voce narrante che invece ho visto poco se non in alcuni momenti toccanti ogni tanto; ma trovo che alla fine si riesca a empatizzare abbastanza con Lily Hu e che la scrittura così lineare, per quanto un po’ troppo “raccontata”, vada bene per raccontare di una vita adolescente.-•Devo dire però che parte di questo mio non totale apprezzamento per è dovuto a una cosa che ancora di più mi è dispiaciuta: avrei voluto di più del contesto storico-politico, che ho trovato sì coerente, ma non ricco quanto speravo. E questo passa soprattutto attraverso Lily perché, nei nuclei tematici scelti, cioè la paura anti-comunista e discriminazione contro i cinesi, non c’è nessuna reazione particolare da parte della protagonista che renda certi eventi cruciali. Non c’è elaborazione di pensieri da parte sua, spesso recepisce le informazioni in modo quasi passivo: quando requisiscono i documenti di cittadinanza al padre si limita a chiedere quando li riavrà indietro; quando la rimproverano per essere andata al picnic di una Lega giovanile comunista (dove ci sono più descrizioni del cibo che di quello che è il posto… per dire 💀) non si chiede perché reagiscono così riguardo a quella collettività, né lei sul momento quel pomeriggio lo ha commentato; si citano i sospetti di comunismo della cerchia di amici, ma più di un’esclamazione di stupore non si aggiunge nulla; quando Lily legge un opuscolo sul comunismo scritto dal punto di vista di critica americana, è curiosa, ma non riflette sul perché sia così demonizzato in quel paese; così come in un’altra scena in cui trova un opuscolo con delle frasi di giuramenti americani di libertà e patriottismo, e non si chiede come mai quella politica funzioni in quel modo.Varie occasioni di inserire sequenze riflessive sono state sprecate.Ed è strano visto che per esempio vi è un paragrafo in cui definisce i temi politici trattati a casa sua come “intriganti barlumi di un mondo adulto che sembrava completamente separato dalla realtà mondana della sua vita quotidiana. Quando quel mondo interferiva con il suo la disorientava.”È una bella frase, ma lascia un po’ il tempo che trova se nel resto del libro, proprio da ragazza giovane quale è, lei non si fa domande sulle questioni che in modo naturale giustamente non capisce, non si caratterizza l’origine di quell’opposizione e atti contro le persone cinesi e viene fatto passare in sordina il fatto che non si aggiunga altro. Non abbastanza, direi.Soprattutto, capisco che il focus fosse il confronto comunità cinese-associazione con il comunismo-maccartismo americano, ma: intanto non si sono ben capite le origini anche solo di questo, come già detto si potevano dire altro perché non tutti le conoscono e il “clima generale di paura” non basta, senza qualche puntino sulla i; e poi, non per fare una storica puntigliosa perché non lo sono, ma per me non si può parlare di quel decennio in America con riferimenti al comunismo senza parlare della Guerra Fredda, qui i russi sono menzionati come deduzione automatica dal comunismo del periodo, ma la tensione in tutta la popolazione americana era su tantissimi livelli (e sì, ho apprezzato la scena dell’esercitazione per gli attacchi aerei di esplosivi, viene spiegato il perché, ma si poteva dire altro visto che il contrasto era tutto ideologico).Insomma, qui in Italia alle scuole superiori si arriva a malapena alla 2ª Guerra mondiale- io è un caso che le so per un corso fatto all’università, ma per il resto queste specifiche di politica internazionale non le sa quasi nessuno da cultura generale, e secondo me più che per intuizione qui le informazioni non vanno oltre.Il difficile di scrivere romanzi a sfondo storico è proprio equilibrare le cose realmente accadute con la storia di fantasia, e comunicarle bene perché di certo non si può fare in modo didascalico quasi come un commentario punto per punto, ma devono esserci eventi da sfruttare per evidenziare certi elementi, incontri con questioni politiche, caratterizzazioni della mente di chi narra per far capire da che parte del mondo a livello sociale si sta. E questo può avvenire tramite pensieri, dialoghi, oggetti inseriti in certi luoghi, per carità non mi aspetto un info dumping stile saggio -che appunto narrativamente sarebbe sbagliato-, ma neanche un paio di cose e poi perse via così :”””)-•La parte più interessante è sicuramente il Telegraph Club, le descrizioni che per quanto semplici rendevano benissimo l’atmosfera di questo lesbian bar e di tutta la storia che si continuava a formare in ogni interazione tra donne. È il luogo stesso in cui Lily si forma al completo, in cui conferma il suo percorso di questioning del suo orientamento e, al contempo, scopre lati di sé legati alla personalità e all’approccio sociale che la rendono una persona nuova e completa. Dalle prime scene in cui era a disagio e osservava come un sogno impossibile “l’attrice in abiti maschili” esibirsi al pianoforte, stando all’ombra seduta sui divanetti, pian piano comincia a fare proprio quello spazio, delle mura fatte apposta per accogliere una comunità marginalizzata da sempre in pericolo. Appena si legge di Lily che varca la soglia di quel locale, si percepisce quel calore e quella speranza di vivere in quel modo, e al contempo la segretezza con cui lascia i ricordi in un angolo della sua mente, quello in cui si può liberare del ruolo di “brava ragazza cinese” sempre composta e perfetta per la sua famiglia e per la scuola, in cui può conoscere ragazze come lei, ammirarle e voler diventare come loro, che definisce “vive” (in ogni suo pensiero quando ad esempio i genitori le chiameranno discriminatoriamente aride e di passaggio).Il percorso di Lily è bellissimo, realistico nelle ambiguità di emozioni tra omofobia internalizzata, che purtroppo tutti proviamo in una società che demonizza la queerness, e accettazione e orgoglio man mano che lo capisce:“Avrebbe dovuto sentirsi sporca per averlo letto e in colpa per essere così elettrizzata a quel pensiero.Il problema era che non si sentiva così. Invece si sentiva come se avesse finalmente risolto l’ultima parte di un codice su cui si era scervellata per così tanto tempo da non ricordare nemmeno quando aveva iniziato a decifrarlo. Si sentiva euforica.”“Non era come il cioccolato. Era come trovare l’acqua dopo una siccità. Non riusciva a berne abbastanza e la sua sete la faceva vergognare, e la sua sete la faceva arrabbiare.”-&gt; Lily capisce di volere di più e di meritarselo, ed elimina quei residui di pensieri oppressivi sapendo di non essere sbagliata, convincendosene ancora di più con i gruppi di lesbiche che frequenta al Club. In modo diretto ma di cui si capisce la potenza, viene ben rappresentato questo passaggio e quanto fosse importante, in un’epoca come quella, aggregarsi dove si poteva per riconoscersi a vicenda.Belle e spontanee anche le descrizioni del modo in cui capisce l’attrazione per le ragazze a livello strettamente fisico:“Lily aveva visto i passi del club di danza e dello Schiaccianoci ogni Natale per tutte le scuole superiori, ma quell’anno per la prima volta era consapevole di ciò che stava guardando. Le gambe delle ragazze e le ombre tra di loro, le curve delle cosce e dei polpacci, la scollatura resa visibile dai loro body. Le ballerine dovevano essere state sempre le stesse, ma Lily sentiva come se fosse la prima volta che le vedeva veramente: il peso dei loro corpi, la vitalità e il calore della pelle rosa.”…E in questo anche la triste presenza del male gaze, parte integrante delle coppie etero perché su influenza della dominazione patriarcale, e ciò purtroppo lo riflette anche lei: “Una coppia di ragazzi nella fila davanti a Lily fischiava a volontà e quando l’insegnante scese giù lungo il corridoio per metterli a tacere, Lily lasciò cadere lo sguardo sulle ginocchia, come se fosse stata lei a essere ammonita.”-&gt; Ma fortunatamente capisce poi che i suoi pensieri non sono paragonabili a una molestia, e c’è un’ingenuità realistica anche qui:“C’era una differenza tra i fischi di quei ragazzi e quello che lei stava pensando, ma non era ancora sicura del perché e del motivo di quella differenza. Sapeva soltanto che si sentiva ipnotizzata e arrossì.”Non solo con sé stessa interiormente, ma anche nelle serate al Telegraph Club, vediamo come le emozioni di Lily includano dalla paura alla vergogna, all’incertezza e alla gioia, alla conoscenza di una cultura tutta nuova, delle coppie butch/femme lesbians e di come appaiono così diverse trasgredendo le regole di espressione di genere, apprendendo una nuova quotidianità e linguaggi in codice in un luogo in cui può rivedersi.D’altronde sappiamo anche la frequenza di rischi e poi concretizzazioni di violenza che avvenivano in quei locali, attraverso i raid della polizia, irruzioni che finivano con arresti su base omofoba secondo condanne che erano solo falsità, come le accuse di adescamento di minori e pedofilia, spaccio di droghe e condotta oscena. È stato triste ma anche interessante quel punto della trama in cui proprio quella notte (“La scorsa notte” la perifrasi sul piano cronologico usata anche nel titolo, riprendendo questo momento clue della storia) venga arrestata Kathleen, la ragazza di Lily e love interest dall’inizio del libro, e si fa ben vedere la conseguenza della risonanza di un intervento armato nel solo “essere visti lì vicino”, la notizia sul giornale, lo spaesamento perché dovunque Lily andasse c’era il pericolo di essere sola e rifiutata (eccetto la veritiera solidarietà di altre ragazze lesbiche nel riferimento anche storico al bisogno di sostegni economici); quei capitoli di attesa e disperazione da quando scappa di casa, dopo il litigio con la madre di violenza omofoba verbale e fisica, l’obbligo al silenzio rispetto al resto della famiglia, il trasferimento in un altro stato “per evitare pettegolezzi nella zona”. Si mischia l’esclusione nel pratico alla reputazione sociale per lo strano clima anti-cinese già presente, e si percepisce come qualunque cosa possa essere per lei un passo falso. Straziante e terribilmente vero.-•Un’altra cosa che ho apprezzato di Lily, più che di lei nel singolo, è la caratterizzazione delle sue relazioni, soprattutto quella di amicizia con Shirley: un’ottima dimostrazione di un’amicizia tossica fin dall’inizio, che passa attraverso la gelosia, il non volere che l’altra abbia altri amici, l’addossamento di sensi di colpa per il futuro andarsene e farsi un’altra vita, un carisma che diventa disparità di potere poiché Shirley sembra averne di più, tanto da far dare per buoni il profondo orgoglio e l’incapacità di chiedere scusa perché è ciò a cui Lily si è abituata, per finire anche qui con l’omofobia aperta, e quindi un rapporto che solo a un certo punto Lily mette in discussione. È la classica amicizia fin dall’infanzia di cui si perdonano tutti i difetti e le nocività perché lo stare sempre insieme e il condividere tutto, avere quell’unica persona come punto saldo, trae in inganno nascondendo i lati negativi.-•L’aspetto socio-culturale di Chinatown all’interno di San Francisco è poi molto interessante, tra descrizioni estetiche di certi posti e dinamiche lavorative compresi i confronti con i turisti, un’area solo relativamente protetta ma al contempo anche molto chiusa in convenzioni sociali date dall’appartenenza alla stessa etnia e il timore di fuoriuscirne. Per non parlare della strana dinamica nell’essere cittadini americani e cercare di bilanciarlo con l’origine cinese, di cui l’espressione è per esempio il concorso Miss Chinatown, inventato dagli americani bianchi in un senso ovviamente razzista e “esotico” sfruttando il guardare le donne cinesi e per renderle emblemi di bellezza, dimostrando che anche quel popolo poteva essere integrato nel paese (nel tipico liberalismo idealistico accondiscendente sempre avuto dalla fantomatica libertà negli USA); ad esso partecipa il personaggio di Shirley, determinata a vincere per mostrare di essere abbastanza per l’America ma anche ancora abbastanza cinese per non deludere Chinatown e rimanere affine alla gente che l’ha cresciuta, ed è stato straniante sapere che era un evento storicamente reale e leggerne l’analisi dell’autrice a fine libro.Inoltre, per quanto avrei voluto più attenzioni a questioni politiche come, appunto, la cittadinanza americana -e i documenti di cui non si è neanche più parlato dopo la confisca- e le radici del pregiudizio anti-comunista, si percepisce che Lily deve mantenere la sua identità cinese che contrasta, solo in base alle regole rigide ed eternormative con cui è stata educata, con la scoperta dell’identità queer. Due mondi che apparentemente non possono stare insieme, e di cui in effetti la ragazza non ha esempi poiché nel gay bar è sempre l’unica cinese.Questo porta ovviamente all’altra denuncia alla discriminazione che è il razzismo, da quello per le strade con molestie e cat calling da parte di uomini bianchi, al fetish persino dalle ragazze lesbiche nel Club che la appellano come “non abbiamo molte così da queste parti” (e da ciò e dalle note dell’autrice sul linguaggio ho anche scoperto che il termine “orientale” è offensivo, e ancora non si usava quello corretto cioè asioamericano in quella nazione), e Lily deve combattere interiormente tra il sentirsi offesa come giustamente è senza che i bianchi se ne rendano conto, e il non dire nulla per il solo fatto di aver trovato un posto con persone *in parte* come lei in quanto queer. Seppur in un setting storico, leggerlo ora è un reminder dell’importante tema dell’intersezionalità: far parte di una minoranza non rende esenti dall’avere altri privilegi, in questo caso quello di etnia bianca, e pur sempre un occhio discriminatorio automatico dentro con cui nuocere.-• Un’ultima cosa che ho, invece, in parte apprezzato e in parte visto in modo quasi neutro, è la relazione romantica con Kath: io amo il friends to lovers trope, ancora di più quando è molto lento, e mi è piaciuta la semplicità con cui diventano amiche e poi amanti attraverso il vedere le forti passioni l’una dell’altra, Lily per l’astronomia e Kath per il volo (e i giochi di parole su classiche frasi espressive del tipo “sentirsi sopra le nuvole per l’amore”), e lo scoprire di voler stare insieme perché trovano a tal punto un conforto recoproco. Tutto molto romantico. E anche abbastanza emotivo il momento di distacco bruscò da quando Kath viene arrestata a quella notte del raid e rimangono distanti per tempo. Ma dopo questo il finale è stato compresso, l’Epilogo è brevissimo e per un salto temporale di un anno mi aspettavo di più: viene usata la tecnica narrativa del sommario per dire dove hanno studiato e ora lavorano le due, si parlano per frasi veloci come “mi sei mancata” “dimmi come stai” “ti amo” e una promessa di un appuntamento per ricominciare a vedersi. Ma non c’è pathos, non ci sono descrizioni della sorpresa di rivedersi dopo tutto quel caos né un pensiero per come vogliono relazionarsi da ora in futuro, si riprende solo l’amore in generale. Davo per scontato che avrei letto almeno un paio di lettere che si erano scambiate, per vedere il modo in cui si esprimevano in quel momento particolare a distanza, il raggiungimento dei loro sogni senza però poterne parlare faccia a faccia- soprattutto da parte di Kath, visto che non sappiamo nulla di lei -a parte la sua ambizione lavorativa- e la sua personalità è molto abbozzata, era necessaria anche quella narrazione.Un peccato, perché il salto così rapido con ben un dialogo così piatto non rende chissà cosa il finale.-• Altra pecca è poi che tante cose potevano essere dette meglio in sostituzione di scene di quotidianità che sì, servono un po’, ma non ripetute chissà quante- i dialoghi con la migliore amica riguardo al ballo studentesco, l’uscita a prendere un gelato (ripetuta una seconda volta in un altro posto e infatti praticamente uguale😭), i movimenti per la casa per i compiti da fare, quelli nelle aule di scuola… Molto inutili, perché non accompagnati da pensieri di, di nuovo, quotidiana adolescenza che sono io la prima ad apprezzare, quelle scene che nella routine di tutti i giorni dovrebbero dire qualcosa.Così come i capitoli dal punto di vista della madre, del padre e della zia- carino sapere del background soprattutto in quanto famiglia cinese e l’influenza culturale su questo nucleo sociale, ma non apportavano molto, non venivano ripresi i membri famigliari se non in negativoInsomma- A volte, soprattutto nella prima parte, le scene non avevano peculiarità se non l’essere minime azioni già dette, e quei capitoli diventavano a dir poco vuoti.—————————————————————————Comunque, alla fin fine, è un bel libro che consiglio, ma per me si poteva fare di più. Ho amato ovviamente le note storiche dell’autrice alla fine, sul linguaggio e scrittura cinese, sulla comunità queer in generale e su quella lesbica nello specifico con definizioni sub-culturali, le interviste e i racconti da una poetessa lesbica e da un’altra donna che le ha parlato del significato di essere lesbica e cinese in quel periodo;oppure sulla comunità di immigrati cinesi e come funzionavano le migrazioni, addirittura ha raccontato di come ci sono arrivati i suoi nonni e che la famiglia del personaggio di Lily è in parte ispirata alla sua. L’ho trovato adorabile 🥹✨Rimane un piacevole YA coming of age che racconta una storia mai letta prima, soprattutto in Italia dove è ancora necessario tradurre libri queer per giovani, soprattutto al femminile. Pur parlando di un periodo storico in cui si doveva far partire un giradischi in un locale nascosto per evadere dal silenzio oppressivo, dà comunque quel barlume di nota musicale di dolcezza, che Lily e Kath siano tornate insieme alla fine, che tante altre possano farlo in futuro, ma anche che dobbiamo ricordare il passato sociale di quelle come noi che hanno fatto propri questi club, rischiando pur di essere loro stesse🤞❤️🏳️‍🌈—-QUOTES🌈:-“Haven’t you ever wondered what it would be like to have nothing keeping you attached to the ground?“-“She’s having a hard time right now because you’re not what she expected. But we’re never what our parents expected. They have to learn that lesson.”-“Perhaps that was the most perverse part of this: the inside-outness of everything, as if denial would make it go away, when it only made the pain in her chest tighten, when it only made her emotions clearer.”-“Are you like the girls in the book too? Because I think I am.”-«Falling in love, I guess.»«You’ll know,» Claire said. «It’s unmistakable.»(How she could recognize Kath at the other end of a crowded Galileo hallway by the way she walked.)«It’s like . . . well, it’s like falling,» Lana said. «Falling, or floating, or sinking.»(Every time they kissed.)«You won’t know which way is up.»«It’s like having a fever.»(The way the world seemed to narrow down to the tips of Kath’s fingers.)«It’s like being drunk—drunk for days.»-“The word felt dangerous, and also powerful, as if uttering it would summon someone or something”-“An unfamiliar emotion swelled inside her at this image. A strangely sharp pang for a place she had never visited. For a people she resembled but did not know.” My procrastination abilities are questionable. I am a selective procrastinator, which is to say I choose to procrastinate on some things and finish others by the speed of light. This book was one of those selective procrastinator scenarios — I found myself attempting to finish 150 pages of an overdue book on a Friday night, where I usually would’ve been rotting in my chair with a cup of boba browsing YouTube. But much had changed. New year, new Sophia. I decided I was going to minimize my boba consumption to two a week instead of the usual five or six for the sake of the environment. I was tired and still rotting in my chair — but this time with a book in hand. At the end of an hour and a half, I had cried, laughed out loud (to the surprise of my mom, who immediately assumed I was browsing the internet and off-task) and wanted to give Lily’s parents a very educated talk on how it is physically impossible to “turn someone gay.”When I first started this book, I found it incredibly boring. The plot line moved along slowly, and it took 250 pages of romantic tension for Lily and Kath to finally admit they had feelings for each other. I was constantly reminding myself that this was 1950s San Francisco, but the thought that they had to hide their relationship still infuriated me nonetheless. There is an infuriating amount of racism in this time period. Even at the Telegraph Club (a gay bar in a time where gays are not accepted), the women are still astonished when they find out Lily can speak English. Lily must’ve thought this sort of behavior was normal, as she faces racism almost everywhere. Her father also faces deportation, as his citizenship papers have since been seized by the FBI because he refused to admit his client was a communist. The United States was on a lookout for communists in 1954, and targeted the Chinese. The comments made by men in this book disgust me. When Lily decides she wants to go to the Telegraph Club, she has to deal with comments from men about her dress and appearance, and revolting phrases such as “come here, China doll” force me to question my faith in humanity. Towards the end of the book, much action happens at once to the point where it is overwhelming. Shirley, one of Lily’s friends from Chinatown who just so happens to have the most entitled attitude ever, tells Lily that someone saw her outside the Telegraph Club the night after it got raided by the police. Now this is where I laughed out loud. Shirley refused to accept that Lily was a lesbian, and when Lily grabbed her arm as Shirley left, Shirley looked down at her hand wrapped around her arm and said something along the lines of “I think we should stay away from each other.” And then I realized: Shirley thought Lily had a crush on her. This is a problem that many members of the LGBTQ+ community still face, so I’d like to make it clear. If your friend that identifies as a girl is gay, that does not mean she automatically has a crush on you. If your friend that identifies as male is gay, that does not mean he automatically has a crush on you, and so on. Lily then tells her mother, and her mother tries to convince Lily that “it’s just a phase!” “It’s a mistake!” “When you go to college and get a boyfriend, it will pass.” And I sat there shaking my head. It was the night before Chinese New Year, and Lily soon left the house and ran to Lana — one of the women who were regulars at the Telegraph Club — and showed up at the front steps of her apartment. When she went back to her home the day after, she continued to put on her persona of a “good Chinese girl” and stayed that way.The next day, her parents told her she would be moving in with her Aunt in another town because Kath was allegedly a “distraction.” In short, the book ends a year later, after Lily and Kath have both left high school, and decide to meet up after a year of maintaining a long-distance relationship. By the time I finished the book, the uncertainty was unsettling. It was Chinese New Year in 1955, and Lily was still planning on spending it with her family. I was forced to believe many things that I didn’t want to. I knew Lily would never be accepted by her family no matter how much they loved her. I knew Kath and Lily would probably never be a couple again. I knew that this was 14 years before Stonewall, and roughly 10 years before the Civil Rights Act would be signed into law. I knew Lily’s dreams of pursuing a career in the STEM field would likely never become a reality, even if women had gained the right to vote decades before she was born. Her opportunities would likely be taken by her white, straight, and male counterparts, and that was the sad reality of the 1950s.I put down the book feeling defeated. I didn’t know what would happen to them, and that killed me. Nonetheless, this book is still an amazing read, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes historical fiction or getting emotional over a book.  4 Stars! I read this book for YA book club, and I’m very excited to hear the discussion on this book! Summary-Last Night at the Telegraph Club takes place in San Francisco’s Chinatown in the 1950’s. The story follows Lily Hu, who is Chinese American and is best friends with Shirley, who is also Chinese American. The girls are starting their senior year of school, and Lily is put in an advanced math group with Kathleen Miller who is a white girl in their school and someone Lily has known for years but has never been particularly close to. Lily starts to have feelings for Kathleen, and she starts questioning her sexuality, but she must keep her relationship with Kathleen secret because being in a lesbian relationship in the 1950’s was considered “unnatural” and “wrong.” Together the two of them secretly attend the Telegraph Club, which is a lesbian bar in San Francisco, but Shirley finds out about Lily and confronts her about feelings for Kathleen. Plot and Setting- WOW! I think the setting and plot were very well done in this book! The author did a great job placing me in Chinatown in the 1950’s. There are some books where I can’t even remember what decade I’m supposed to be in while I’m reading, but with this book, I never wavered from the setting or plot. It was incredibly well researched, and the representation in this book was everything I’ve been looking for. (Especially the Chinese American heritage parts.) Characters-I found the main characters to be likable. I found myself rooting for Lily and Kath. Some of the side characters didn’t do much for the story, and I didn’t really care for the flashbacks. There are flashbacks to Lily’s parents, and this part of the book shows more historical context. However, the flashbacks didn’t really do much for me, and I kept thinking there would be more to them but was a little disappointed to find out they were ���just there to be there.” I really thought Aunt Judy was going to end up being gay. The flashbacks felt a little disconnected to me and took me out of the story. It would have been so much better if they would have enhanced the story by having a really cool reason for being there. Pacing-It took me awhile to really start liking this book. I don’t know if it was a “slow start” or if I had to get used to the slow-moving plot, but I didn’t start loving this until there was more conflict happening with the girls. Once Lily becomes more aware of her feelings for Kathleen, I became more invested in the characters and the overall story. Overall-I really enjoyed this book! I think it’s well researched and well written, and I think there are YA readers out there that will love this book. I would highly recommend this to YA readers who are looking for a different type of historical fiction. There seem to be a lot of unanswered potholes though. It’s almost like the book was 200 pages longer and the editor told the author to make the book shorter and cut out certain side plots, but then forgot to comeback to tell the reader what happened with everything. It was really weird to have so many things mentioned in the book like they were going to become important parts of the plot later in the book, and then to find out that they were just completely ignored. Unanswered side stories: -Lily’s dad’s citizenship papers were taken, and never really mentioned again. -Shirley's boyfriend (Calvin?) has communist ties but was never really mentioned again. -Everything about the Red Scare and the communist subplot just didn’t matter? -We never find out what happened to Kath after being arrested. -The ending was very open.   “It wasn’t like chocolate, Lily thought. It was like finding water after a drought. She couldn’t drink enough, and her thirst made her ashamed, and the shame made her angry.” (p. 165)SynopsisLily (Lilian Hu) and Kath (Katherine Miller) have been classmates in high school for a few years, but their friendship did not blossom until they were in advanced math class, during their junior year. Lily’s interests (supported by her aunt Judy, who works at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory) are in mathematics and computers, and Kath is interested in being a pilot. These interests are one link in their friendship, in times where having these careers by women was not popular. Lily was curious about lesbians, seeking literature about the topic, and Kath helped answer her questions. Their friendship transitions into a natural love for each other, but in the mid 1950s, this relationship is less accepted, and they must navigate stereotypes and biases by hiding, being secretive and breaking house rules. PerspectiveThis is multi-layered novel of self-discovery, where Lily learns that she is attracted to women and falls in love with Kath. Lily is Chinese American, and Kath is Caucasian, furthering the differences between their backgrounds but unifying the story with their love. The progression of Lily’s and Kath’s love is very natural and patient, as Lily recognizes and accepts her sexual preferences. Besides the central theme, Lo beautifully embeds other layers, including parenting, discrimination against Chinese people, female beauty and stereotypes, Chinese culture, communism, the threat of deportation of Chinese immigrants, and true friendships and betrayal. The U.S.A. has people of different ethnicities and preferences and neighborhoods that support the different cultures. This is well illustrated in the novel. Sections end with the portrayal of a member of Lily’s family, her mother Grace, her father Joseph or her Aunt Judy and their lives years earlier. These chapters are preceded by a timeline, accounting what is happening at the time and highlighting the segment that will be narrated. According to the author, her editor advised her to include the adults’ point of view. I think this was a good idea, but I don’t think I gained much from it. On the other hand, I thought that Kath’s voice was almost imperceptible. I wished I that her character would have been developed further. The research of the times (mid-1950s) and homosexual views and setting, San Francisco, California, at this time, was well researched. I attended a conference hosted by the English Department at Kansas State University where Malinda Lo described the research that went into the novel. She was truthful to the times. I wish she would have included a map of the region, Chinatown, the school and surrounding neighborhoods. She showed this map in her presentation and would have provided a visual of the physical relationship between places and streets mentioned in the book.  RecommendationIf you are interested in cultural differences and gender preference in the 1950s, this book presents good accurate examples. This is depicted in the context of a true historical background of how Asian American in San Francisco fight discrimination and biases but persevere. It is a book for young and not so young adults. It is perhaps longer than necessary but entertaining and worth reading.  I remember first reading Malinda Lo’s Ash, very long ago, and having the story stick in my mind like a filmic blear. Something about Lo’s writing, how she tweaks existing stories to tell something new, left an impression on me. Reading Last Night at the Telegraph Club, a historical YA novel focused on the coming of age of Lily Hu, the eldest daughter of a Chinese-American immigrant family, I felt again impressed by Lo’s writing. She has managed to balance a number of complex historical threads to tell an affecting story, one positioned at the intersection of race and sexual identity.The existence of Chinese-American immigrants has always been one of adapting to nationalist doctrine and political fears. Before the movement to establish Asian American solidarity had built momentum, Asian communities residing on the coasts were splintered by historical forces. Last Night of the Telegraph Club captures the fears of the Chinese community, having seen the Japanese communities rounded up in internment camps and their lands dispossessed during WW1. Caught between the bipolar ideological war between capitalism and communism, Lily’s family and friends take care to present as respectable, American people, even if that means a curtailment of one’s hopes and dreams. Lo writes engagingly of the community in San Francisco’s Chinatown and of the various businesses and associations that compose it. Her parents feature in interludes that outline their backgrounds – her father a scholar sent to America to learn medicine, her mother an American-born nurse. Their involvement in WW1 is specifically highlighted, reminding us of how their lingering traumas subtly impacts their relationship with Lily, and the expectations they hold of her.What intrigues me more is Lo’s focus on queer history – in particular the experiences of queer Asians. It was fascinating to read the level of research Lo conducted in making this book. I’m inclined to believe Lo’s presentation of 50’s queer culture. And while Lo tries to soften the blow of racism– there were portions of the book where I felt deeply uncomfortable reading how Lily was treated when navigating white-dominant queer spaces. There is already such inherent risk in being queer, but to be queer and Chinese during that period struck me as incredibly lonely. The worst consequences are avoided, steered aside by Lo’s plot and characters – and in fact lampshaded very neatly by Lo’s inclusion of lesbian pulp romance novels in the plot – but I would say Lo’s very willing to let the characters suffer painful consequences and interactions. Yes, this is a young adult book, but it’s not going to handwave the experiences of racism or homophobia away. In this, it differs from Benjamin Alire Saenz’s book, Aristotle and Dante Dive into the Waters of the World, also nominated for a 2021 Goodreads award (read my review here), but it is not any worse for doing so. In fact, I appreciated the grittiness of this setting.The strength of Lo’s writing lies not in its characters, but in the ambition of its plot and the realism of its setting. Meticulously researched, it makes for an absorbing read. The history it represents is one I welcome to YA literature.  4.5/5I loved this book so much. Lo is so deft at tackling nuanced topics that are interwoven into each other so seamlessly. I wish I had this book to read as a teenager / college student. While I always exhibited sapphic tendencies as a child, it was really solidified in my brain that I was bi in college. I think having a text like this to relate to would have allowed myself to notice and claim it a lot earlier, particularly as there aren't weren't may stories about queer Asian women at the time so I could not even see myself as such. There were many layers of this book that resonated with me: what it means to be an Asian American, how to be a "good" American, a "good" Chinese girl, while also understanding what it means to be different in the way that you love and the things you are interested in. Outside of sexuality, it also shows the complex coming-of-age story of outgrowing friends who do not wish you to grow beyond what your past history of friendship has dictated. It is also a story of the Chinese family experience, the sense of community that could be so easily shattered by making individualistic decisions deemed as reckless or immorally wrong.I loved the chapters from different perspectives and the inclusion of real life historical events. I feel like I learned so much about my hometown Bay Area (albeit SF) and its history regarding Asian American (Chinatowns, communism) and LGBT communities. I loved how it showed that while Lily was exploring her sexuality and understanding it on a deeper level, the safe spaces she had to explore those feelings were not always necessarily safe spaces for her as an Asian woman. These spaces were still predominantly white and while those people were not outright racist, there were micro-aggressions that we still see present today within predominantly white spaces, queer or otherwise.My one qualm is that I do wish there was more time spent on the perspectives of Lily's mother, father, and aunt, and I also wish we could have seen more moments between Lily and her siblings and aunt. I think those would have added an extra layer of impact with the final conflict and resolution point. Having those characters more fully developed would have really made us as readers know the reasoning behind certain choices they made at the end of the book. I especially loved the few small moments between Lily and her two brothers and you could see the uncomplicated and unconditionally love they had for each other that was not present in Lily's parents. It would have been nice to see more moments like that, or at least more moments of support from people within Lily's life outside of Kath.This book was so good and I definitely recommend to everyone. I cried a lot in many moments, especially the end. This book will break your heart at the unfairness in which queer people are treated but will fill you with hope in the capacity in which people are able to love, and find community and refuge with each other.  I picked this book up on whim because the back of the book mentioned it had a 'soft LGBTQ romance set in the 1950s' and it had a STUNNING front cover. Consider me sold on reading this book. Not to mention, I am always here for a story about vintage lesbians!What I didn't expect was to actually enjoy this book as much as I did. I don't venture into YA books much anymore, but this one was engaging enough to have me finishing it completely in 4 days (a feat i have not achieved since I was a teenager). Lily Hu, our protagonist, was a lovely character. I loved following her journey through discovering herself, her blossoming sexuality and falling in love for the first time. The story being set in the 1950s, with Lily being a Chinese American and on top of that being a lesbian too made the story all that more interesting but definitely more complicated for poor Lily. The story didn't skirt around other issues either. Malinda Lo brilliantly tied together the struggles of discovering you're a lesbian and also the societal and familial pressures of growing up Chinese during a time when neither (and often now still) were well accepted in America at that time. Her turmoil was heart breaking. I LOVED the characters and the atmosphere that Malinda Lo displayed at the Telegraph Club. The home for those who had no place to go to be themselves, but also showed the dangers of these places too in this era. I would have loved to get to see more of that cast of characters. I have to mention to romance aspect of course! The young relationship between Lily and Kath was sweet. I loved getting to see they early stages of interest turn into what they both thought was an unrequited crush to first love. Given the events of the last few chapters of the book I had a moment of despair in thinking that the relationship between them would end up not being a happy one but I was pleasantly surprised that it did not go that way. There is not enough LGBT+ stories with a happy ending, especially ones that include young LGBT+ characters. Shout out to the author for all the extra work she provided in this book. I really loved seeing the Chinese characters when characters were speaking Mandarin or Cantonese but also provided the translations in the footnotes - very cool addition. The author's note section at the end with all the research and extra information was a brilliant addition as well and would be especially useful for readers who are not familiar with some of the aspects and themes that occurred within the book.All in all, I enjoyed this little book and I am very glad I was enticed by a beautiful cover and the soft baby vintage lesbians - all good things wrapped up in a quick and meaningful read.   “Last Night at the Telegraph Club” by Malinda Lo was the January pick for my book club. It’s about a young, first generation Chinese American girl named Lily. She lives in Chinatown in San Francisco in the 1950s - the era of McCarthyism and the Korean War. It is also a time where the United States is unaccepting of the LGBTQ community. To be honest, the word community is used generously here because at that time the only communities you could find where secretive and/or underground for fear of being arrested and publicly shamed/outed. Lily, who is sixteen, is questioning her sexuality in the beginning of the book, but has to do so in secret for the reasons mentioned above. Her best friend is a wannabe pageant queen, her parents have worked hard to create a life in America for her family, and she recently has warmed to another schoolmate who is seemingly questioning her own sexuality as well.The pros: I absolutely loved the setting. Chinatown in the 1950s was such a sight. The descriptions and vibe came alive for me. Lo, the author, wrote well and did plenty of research, which she discusses in depth after the epilogue. I appreciated that, and read all of it, which added to my adoration for the setting. I enjoyed listening to Lily’s inner monologue as she explored her sexuality, particularly the first time she visited the Telegraph Club where she went with her friend, Kath. The club they visited had a female performer who dressed in men’s clothing, something that fascinated Lily. The patrons of the club seemed to be mostly part of the LGBTQ community. I loved being witness to Lily and Kath’s budding relationship. It was very relatable. The cons: I started to skim over the parts about the pageant. Lily didn’t seem to care about it so much, so why should I? I felt there were too many pages dedicated to the pageant preparation and not enough dedicated to explaining what happened with the “witch-hunt” for Communist sympathizers and what happened to Kath once the Telegraph Club was raided by police. I also didn’t care for the flashbacks. They seemed like a waste of time and they didn’t really lead to anything. Overall, totally worthy of 4 to 4.5 stars. The historical fiction aspect of this book was my favorite. Learning about Chinatown in the 1950s is something I haven’t read much about. I also enjoyed the connections to the LGBTQ community at that time. It reminded me of the Amazon Prime show, “A League of Their Own.” And yes, I do know there is a movie with that same name, but Amazon made a show of it and its around the same time period dealing with the same issues regarding underground, secretive clubs and exploring one’s sexuality. Highly recommend the show and this book! ‘‘The more her mother insisted it was a mistake, the more certain Lily that it wasn’t. Perhaps that was the most perverse part of this: the inside-outness of everything, as if denial would make it go away, when it only made the pain in her chest tighten, when it only made her emotions clearer.’’Sapphic historical fictions are the best things to read, I swear!Telling you that I loved following Lily’s journey is an euphemism. I was so wrapped up in her story that I didn’t want to finish it. It felt so comfortable to follow her and Kath at the Telegraph Club in the middle of night, I had the sensation that I was with them at a table watching Tommy Andrews singing on stage. It’s to tell you how good Malinda Lo’s writing style is, so atmospheric and captivating. Lily’s character development was amazing, I loved how Lily also stays true to herself which I find so inspiring. Also Kath and Lily’s relationship is one of my all time favourites, it makes me want to fall in love and to find the Lily to my Kath. I didn’t know that much about the 50’s before starting this book, and I loved learning more about this very uncertain and complicated time in the history of the US. You learn about Asian American history and Queer history at the same time which is so enriching. Also Malinda Lo wrote a long author’s note at the end about all the historical events and how she wrote the novel, which was amazing and taught me so much. She also shares her select bibliography for the book! I loved how this book portrays such amazing women as Lily, Kath but also Aunt Judy which are all so inspiring and their presences warmed my heart. This story wasn’t always easy as there is racism and homophobia all along, but there’s something extremely comforting about its atmosphere. I’m always so emotional when I read queer historical fictions, especially when I finish them as it has the habit of giving me a shot of queer joy and pride in myself, knowing that queer people have always been here and that they led a path for me and all of us. Anyway 
  read this book
, you will love it! (4.75)‘‘She wondered if Kath could sense her, sitting here on this train as it took away. Perhaps it was impossible, if she closed her eyes and sent out her thoughts along the steel track like a message along a telegraph wire.I love you. I love you.’’  Let me just state for the record that I'm VERY GLAD this book exists. In shining the light it does on its lead character, Lily Hu, Malinda Lo's novel gives life and shape and form and truth to the Asian American experience, while also telling a powerful coming-of-age story for a young queer girl learning about herself, her identity, her desires and her hopes and dreams.It's important that this book is something that can be given to children and young adults now, so that they can see themselves in Lily, and learn about the history and complexity of the two underrepresented communities at which nexus Lily sits.Lo is exceptionally good with infusing rich historical detail into her narrative (I really enjoyed reading her Author's Note at the end of the book). Her descriptions of San Francisco's Chinatown in 1950s America make Lily's family and neighbours come alive. I loved the veracity of Lo's writing when it comes to colouring in Lily's Chinese heritage - such as the actual Chinese words used for dialogue (paired with footnotes, naturally).Now, that being said - I'll confess that I didn't entirely enjoy this reading experience. Personally, Lo's writing favours the functional and the expository, almost to a fault. I kept feeling, especially as the book wore on, that it could have been more judiciously edited. Is there really a need to describe every single action, every single thing Lily sees in a particular scene, while forgetting to add flesh and colour and emotion to one of the novel's key supporting characters?By this, I mean Kathleen Miller, of course, who remains frustratingly opaque by the end. She's almost entirely personality-free, and exists purely to serve Lily's story. This means I never really cared about their relationship beyond how it was affecting Lily herself. There's no chemistry here.It's weird, too, how the book takes veeeeery long to tell Lily's story at the beginning - almost painstakingly so - whereas the final act, in which so many big, awful, weighty things happen, feels rushed and perfunctory. The weighting of the novel feels off; Lo offers me an abundance of detail and depth, except when I want it most. tl;dr I mostly enjoyed it though I had issues with the pacing and plotting, especially towards the end. REALLY glad it exists though!3.5 stars  (7.1/10) - ⭐⭐⭐💫 Content warnings can be found here Last Night at the Telegraph Club is set in 1950s San Francisco, and follows Chinese-American high school student Lily as she is starting to figure out her attraction to women. Together with her new friend Kath, she starts frequenting a lesbian night club, and quickly realizes there might be consequences to her new-found reality. This book is a bit of a weird one to review. At the one hand, I think the 1950s setting in combination with Lily's sexuality and culture was a very unique take, and while I can't fully speak to the representation, I think it was well-rounded and nuanced. My issue, however, is that the setting was more of a backdrop than a fully explored aspect to the story, and this is where the book fell short for me. Part of this is completely my own fault, because I picked this book up under the impression that it was an adult historical fiction, not YA. With that came the expectation of a more in-depth exploration of the threat against the gay community in the form of raids on nightclubs, as well as the horrid treatment of Chinese-Americans in a time where fear of communism was extremely high. Yet, while all these aspects were present in the story as promised by the blurb, they were mostly just put in the background of a coming of age story that frankly didn't interest me all that much on its own. While I thought Lily was an accurate product of her time and environment, I also found her rather lackluster and muted. And with most of the emphasis on her and her questioning of her sexuality, there wasn't enough meat to this story for me to get fully invested. I was much more interested in the lives of the adult women who frequented the Telegraph Club, but that's simply not the book that this was. So while this is not a book I can truly fault for anything and appreciated for quite a few of its topics, it just wasn't fully the book for me. Judging by the ratings, though, it has definitely found its audience, and I would recommend it to people who are in the market for the story that it is.  To be completely honest, I’m having a hard time figuring out exactly how I feel about this book. I’m sitting here at 1:00am after finishing it and I’m a mixed bag of emotions.On the one hand, it was a really beautiful and engaging story of queer communities and they way that they lift each other up in the good times and at the same time support each other through tragedy. But I think I may have been misled a bit by the folks who recommended me this book. I was told this was a feel-good queer story and I’ll be honest, it did not make me feel good.I know the 1950s were an awful time for queer people, obviously. But the whole time as the book progressed, I just became more and more angry and hurt. I know it was an accurate portrayal but it’s still hard to swallow. Even the little lines were absolutely gut-wrenching, like Lily acknowledging that she will never be able to kiss Kath goodbye in public ever. It’s such a raw reminder of what the queer communities before us went through. And these people are still alive today. It just makes you want to cry.And honestly the ending just made me feel angry. More than anything else it felt so unfair and abrupt, which is how Lily felt too of course. However, there was no satisfying conclusion. The epilogue gave a bit of closure but not enough. I felt like the story could have kept going and instead just ran dry. We missed an episode. There was more to tell.But on the flipside, Malinda Lo used this novel to craft an unflinchingly accurate reflection of what it feels like to realize that you’re queer, right down to every little emotional twinge that Lily felt. It was like a mirror being held up to my high school self. And there were a lot of very interesting historical and cultural pieces as well - you can definitely learn lots from reading this book.So yeah, mixed feelings. I think this is an important book and I think it’s a story that needs to get told. I just feel a bit broken after reading it though. The ending is heartbreak with no real reconciliation. It’s an important story but it’s not really a happy one by the end. And I’m just a little bit sad  To all the butches and femmes, past, present, and futureEstoy contentísima de haber empezado el año justo con esta novela. No se si se trata del libro que necesitaba leer justo en este momento o no, pero me atrapó desde las primeras páginas y a partir de ahí supe que no iba a poder parar. Ha habido momentos durante la lectura en los que me levantaba y daba vueltas por el pasillo porque estaba tan emocionada que no podía leer sin desahogarme primero. He releído párrafos, escenas y páginas una y otra vez, y me ha tenido despierta hasta las 3 de la mañana porque, por mucho que quisiera terminar un capítulo e irme a dormir el cuerpo me obligaba a seguir leyendo.No es un libro perfecto ni mucho menos: hay una subtrama que se queda un poco sin resolver (aunque de alguna manera siento que tampoco necesitaba ser resuelta, pues lo que la autora quería enseñar con ella ya estaba hecho), y el desenlace de la trama principal me ha parecido muy precipitado en las últimas páginas. Pero me duele especialmente que el epílogo haya sido tan corto y conciso con todo lo que quedaba por contar. Aun así, no puedo darle menos de 5 estrellas (le daría 500 si pudiera) por todas las emociones que ha evocado en mi desde el principio hasta el final. Me ha hecho sentir visible, orgullosa de quien soy, impaciente ante algunas escenas, impotente y rabiosa ante otras. No he leído mucha ficción histórica en mi vida, pero justo encontrarme con este libro me ha hecho darme cuenta de lo bien que sienta formar parte de un pequeño trocito de esta.Aunque la novela en general se desarrolla en un ambiente super hostil, pues es un retrato de la homofobia en el 1950, he sentido una ternura indescriptible tanto al leer la relación entre la protagonista y su interés romántico como por la solidaridad lésbica. El proceso de autodescubrimiento y aceptación de Lily es durísimo de leer, pero a la vez te llena de orgullo y felicidad ver como va aceptándose progresivamente a si misma, hasta que llega el momento en el que de ninguna manera reniega sobre su identidad. Es un libro que recomiendo leer si o si, siempre y cuando tengáis en cuenta los triggers que tiene.  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - 4.5 starsMalinda Lo was able to transport me into a different world as I was reading. I'm now convinced she's my new favorite author and I've only read one of her books. From the prologue and the very first pages of the book with young Lily and Shirley watching the "Miss Chinatown" pageant and prancing around the stage themselves to the epilogue and the glimpse into her adult life, I was enamored. Lo manages to describe San Francisco in the 1950s so vividly and colorfully and makes this historical fiction book so incredibly wonderful to read. The Telegraph Club is such an amazing setting to read about and be immersed in.I feel kind of honored to have read the story of Lily and the forgotten story of many queer Chinese Americans during the 1900's, as Lo wrote in the Author's Note and Acknowledgments. Lily feels like a character that any queer person can relate to. She describes the quiet moments in her childhood were she felt weird or ashamed, and the moments of young adulthood where she came to the realization and fear of being different. I could see myself in her and I could see moments of my "coming of age" in her as well. That was perhaps the best part of the book - even though I'm a white American living on the East Coast in the 2000's, I can still see myself in Lily. She is such a thoughtful yet brave character and she took small and huge leaps that I as the reader cheered her on for throughout the entire story.The end of the story felt like I was being ripped from San Francisco along with Lily. She finally accepts herself enough just for it all to go away - in a very realistic sense to, as stories like this were common for the time period - queer pride and joy being mistaken for "grooming" and "vulgarity." I honestly thought that Lily and Shirley would reconcile after their first fight but it turns out I was deceived just as Lily was...to have a friend betray you like that is devastating. The familial interactions went from comforting and homely to timid and uneasy. I feel like the end felt inadequate after the whole story was told, but unfortunately, it's realistic. Lily couldn't have stayed without endangering herself and her family and that's the truth of being queer and Chinese in 1950s America. I'm glad Lo didn't compromise the integrity and truthfulness of the time for a "happy" ending. Overall, this was an amazing story and I'm so glad I read it.   This was a spectacular read, I just have to start off with that. The book had a very slice-of-life feel and I absolutely ENJOYED the slow burn romance of Lily &amp; Kath.Lily’s Chinese-American background hits close for me, I thought that was done really well and probably one of my favorite parts of the book. I could relate to all the interactions she had with family members, especially her mother &amp; that often activated my fight-or-flight response lol. Books like this with authentic Asian-American, queer representation make me grateful to be living in the time I am right now, like I definitely would not be able to read this kind of book so openly in the past &amp; I’m also happy I’m reading this book at the age I am now to truly appreciate what it means.There are some characters I’d like to mention in general! I think Lily, Kath, Shirley, &amp; Grace were written very well. I left the book wanting the world only for Lily &amp; Kath. They represent this pioneering LGBTQ+ community that make me grateful for their bravery &amp; sad for what they must have had to endure. But because of people like them, we can live so openly now.I did NOT like Shirley; I would like to fight her in a parking lot. But she was still written really well in a way that made me feel sympathy and dislike her severely at the same time. Overall, she’s a shitty friend!Grace reminds me of my own mother, in some ways she basically is. I’m sure that’s why I understand her so much and what she values (though I don’t necessarily agree with them). I don’t think Grace is a shitty mom but she did do some shitty things!Anyway, I’d like to end this review with the opinion that I thought the ending was sudden. I feel more could have been done with that last part (which I was really struggling with omg I kept tensing up &amp; crying while reading that was a LOT). But the ending did not deter me from this 5-star rating! It was a really beautiful book &amp; a special story for me. I will hold Lily &amp; Kath close to my heart for a long time.  Last Night at the Telegraph Club was one of the choice for Book Coven book club in April. I didn’t really know anything about the story before picking it up, but it taught me about a period in history I didn’t know much about. The book is an interesting perspective on what it was like to be American-born Chinese in the 1950s, along with the LGBTQ+ community.Lily Hu is our protagonist, a 17 year old girl discovering her sexuality for the first time. She’s spent her whole life so far being a good Chinese girl, dressing sensibly and hanging out with her parent-approved best friend Shirley. But when Lily discovers the Telegraph Club, she starts to learn more about who she really is, befriending Kath, the other girl in Advanced Math at school and being true to herself for the first time.I really enjoyed Lily’s desire to work in the space industry and her passion for mathematics and physics. It definitely wasn’t easy for woman in STEM back then, so it was good to see this representation. I loved that Kath appreciated Lily’s passions and understood wanting to work in a male dominated field with ambitions to be a pilot herself. This is in contrast to Shirley and her friends, who Lily starts to feel really separated from the more she spends time with Kath.Communism is also featured in the book, though not heavily. As mentioned in the blurb, Lily’s Dad is threatened with deportation for being a suspected communist sympathiser, but this isn’t explored in much detail with the book choosing to focus more on the struggles of the LGBTQ+ community in the time period. There are also some historical flashbacks from the perspective of the adults in the story which added to the richness of the time period.Overall, I feel this book was very well written – Malinda’s writing voice was a perfect match for the story she told which made it an addictive read, particularly as the plot progressed.  Review #47: *SOUND THE SIRENS* *BLAST THE MUSIC* *START THE FANFARE*This is the best book I have read in 2021!!!!!Countless good things to say about Last Night at the Telegraph Club are running through my head and I'm gonna write a few that are top of mind without spoiling anything super major. Thematically, this book SLAPS. The most salient themes circulate somewhere in and around the idea of self-discovery. Lily's identity is always being challenged by either her community or her own self. Everything is nuanced and complex-- which self-discovery realistically is. Of course I left this book with a pang of sadness for Lily and Kath, even Lily's family and Shirley tbh, but yet I mostly left this book with a deep sentiment of hope, joy and excitement for all the aforementioned characters. Again, the author drives home this idea that nothing is black or white, but there often is a lot of grey space when exploring people's given and chosen identities. I wholeheartedly appreciate that we were given the most holistic view of how Lily and her community process growth beyond San Fransisco Chinatown.Speaking of San Fransisco...my god! What an amazing backdrop for a book! I've really scored big lately on books that just absolutely kill it in the making you feel immersed in the story's location. I have obviously never been to San Fransisco Chinatown in the 1950s but yet I feel like I HAVE. Did I just time travel while reading this book? Yes, yes I did. That, to me, is masterful writing.Last Night at the Telegraph club is easily 5 stars. It has so many aspects I love in a book: coming of age, young love, queer women main characters, relevant historical events, fast-paced dialogue, lots of delicious food descriptions, a FABULOUS climax, not too hard vocabulary and efficient chapters. With confidence, I can say that I will be recommending this to anyone who will listen to me talk about it and I, myself, will 100% be reading it again in the near future.  i guess i will start with adding my updates which i did while reading (i think they show good how i was feeling *while* reading as i write this a few days after finishing the book)18.0% "I don't normally read historical fiction (my knowledge ends around ancient times), but this one is... Soft? Like with soft edges? It doesn't shows like you need to know a history to enjoy this story, it slowly shows you America at this time. It's not brutally showing you anything down your throat, names, dates, organisations. It's soft, subtle, even with the queer part of it. It's so good so far."--&gt; all the book is treating reader like a person who doesn't know about that historical time but it also doesn't treat you like a kid who just heard a word "past", pretty good on that part 38.0% "it feels like warmth, like home I've never been into but crave to be in, to visit, to be among friends and people who feel how I feel" --&gt; yeah, there was a lot of feeling going in me while reading this; this book was somehow able to make my feelings so strong (im old and grumpy in a young body so yeah, not so easy job), just, it was written so well and fiting?  79.0% "i love and hate how this book makes me feel; like me, like home, but now, this aching pain in my chest, the tears i want to cry, the... understanding. harsh understanding. it's historical fiction but some feelings, some harsh words and myths and all the hate stays. in a long time any book ever made me feel, made my feelings so strong and so differential, and all of them - so true." --&gt; people change and people *don't* change, ya know? some hatred, fear of things we don't know, stays inside us, maybe as a type of protection, which doesn't make it suddenly good and we have still to fight it a be a better; it shows how some things from the past stayed till today."ignoring the truth won't make it go away suckers. living in a lie doesn't not spark joy" --&gt; yeah.i don't really know what to add for it to stay as non-spoiler as possible while staying away from describing plot - you can read it on the front page. the most important is said - feelings. a lot of feelings.  I want to start this off by saying, this might be the prettiest book that I own- the cover is gorgeous, my copy is super floppy and everything about it just makes me swoon. this is a historical fiction, based in the United States throughout the 50’s- based around a main character who is a Chinese girl with immigrant parents. It follows historical events that happened in China, Japan and America throughout this time- including historical events to do with the LGBTQ (bars being raided, Supreme Court cases that were heard and others.) I loved the way this was written, I love the timeline of events before every other chapter that kept you up to date with the world events and what was happening in the characters lives at the same time, i loved the dual POV’s as well from the different times to show how things progressed and changed over time. I think the story was really well written, I loved the main character Lily and her depth. the way her sexuality was portrayed, the shame and the cultural issues, the denial and the overwhelming fear of it all- it was just so real and such great representation. It wasn’t watered down or made to seem prettier than it is, it showed everything of what it is like to be a young gay girl. there were so many heartbreaking points in this book, the judgment, the family shame, losing friends, the self hatred- it was difficult to read at times, especially as a young woman who is part of the LGBTQ, I have experienced a lot of these things too. I do want to include some trigger warnings: this book uses language that could be harmful to some members of the LGBTQ, also a warning for: homophobia, racism, and discussions about miscarriages. this book literally transported me to a new world, reading it made me feel as though I was there, I loved this book so much- great representation with a beautiful storyline and deep characters. I recommend.   This book does a phenomenal job encapsulating a girl’s journey in her awareness of both her queer identity and Chinese American identity. While navigating the complex nuances of racism, homophobia, gender inequality and shifting sentiments of the 1950s, Lily remains loyal to herself whilst dreaming big about outer space, exploring childhood friendships, handling family tension, and discovering first loves. When Lily uncovers her queer identity to her parents, I found the metaphor of her feeling “as if she were stuck on a broken track in a diorama” to be particularly memorable. Lily feels torn between upholding cultural precedent and remaining a “good Chinese girl” as expected versus embracing her “otherness” in being queer and not as rigid and nice as society expects. Yet, even when she chooses to not conform to societal expectations, she finds solace in the community she discovers through Telegraph Club and it’s heartwarming to see this sense of belonging blossom through the book.Kath’s character and the way flashbacks are used in the book fell short for me. It felt like Kath’s character was not fully explored and was merely used as a tool in helping Lily dream big and explore her queer identity. I was her character had a bit more layers added to help develop their relationship a bit further. Additionally, while the flashbacks did help provide some further context on the family’s backgrounds, it felt a bit detached in how they all related to Lily’s journey and just felt like intermissions in the story rather than adding to the flow.Nonetheless, this book was a great read and I think the author did an amazing job typing together the historical context of the 1950s in with how Lily navigates her self identity as a young teen, despite the changing landscape and opposing social norms. Queer history is so important. I want to hear the stories of those who came before me, of those who faced challenges that we will never know.Malinda Lo writes so beautiful about first lesbian love in 1950s San Fransico. To read about gay nightclubs in history. What more do you want?The story follows Lily Hu, a 17 year old girl from Chinatown. It follows her through her own self discovery of being queer. It seems such an important thing to write about. I remember that journey of self discovery being difficult in the 21st century, yet to read about it in the 1950s I can't imagine what it would've been like. To read about lesbian love felt so beautiful to me. In a time when they had to be so secret. I loved all the side characters that went to The Telegraph Club too. I could imagine they all had different stories.  "If you lie about it, it will make it easier in the beginning, but your mother will never trust you again. Because she'll know you lied to her. And every time you speak to her she'll wonder if you're lying- even if you're talking about what you had for dinner, and especially who you went to dinner with. It's better to be true to yourself than give her a reason not to trust you." Arguably one the most important aspects of this book is that is showed the Asian-American experience at that time. Lo wrote about the history at the end, and the difficulty she had finding stories of queer people of colour, specifically Asian stories. To read about it was enlightening, about the communist views at the time, and the history of the war and immigration. This book was enlightening in so many ways. “Are you like the girls in the book too? Because I think I am.”  me too, me too  I wish I could absolutely love this book the same way so many other reviewers do, but it was just SO slow. I had to force myself to keep reading it at times because I just wanted to go read fanfic or manga or literally anything else that would actually hold my attention better. Every time something actually exciting or interesting happened in this book and I'd get gripped by the story, the narration would immediately grind to a halt by cutting to a flashback where nothing actually important to the main plot would happen, or Lily going somewhere and just listening as other people talk around her and she wouldn't actually interact at all.The main character in this story is Lily Hu, a 17 year old Chinese-American girl who lives in Chinatown San Francisco in the mid 1950s. The setting for this story is incredibly interesting, because San Francisco's Chinatown is the oldest Chinatown in the US, and San Francisco has a rich queer history. Lily has started to figure out that she might be attracted to women, and is fixated on a newspaper clipping of a male impersonator at a local club. When she starts to get closer to a schoolmate, Kath, and Kath tells her she's been to that club before and can take Lily there, Lily is very interested and decides to go eve though it makes her really anxious.In between parts in this story there are some flashbacks to times that are told from Lily's mother, Lily's father, and Lily's aunt's perspectives. I didn't find that these stories really added much to the plot and were probably just added in as extra context to the period of history the book is set in.Overall, the book is very obviously well researched and interesting for its historical references, but the writing style is extremely dry and the plot very slow and drawn-out.   When I first heard about this book last year, I knew I had to read it. Queer historical YA set in San Francisco? Yes, please! And I have to say living in San Francisco while reading this made my reading experience that much more memorable. Lo does an incredible job of recreating San Francisco of the 1950s. Her descriptions of the City and food are vivid, cinematic, and just plain delectable. Because I knew the streets and neighborhood as they are in the present day, I was easily transported back to the 1950s of San Francisco Chinatown. I could picture myself walking down Grant Avenue eating an egg tart. I could picture myself walking in North Beach towards Coit Tower looking at the beautiful view of the bay. I could also picture the dirty looks and racist comments being slurred at me during all of this. And I didn’t have to try very hard given how xenophobia is still rampant in this exact same city and neighborhood today, 67 years later.1954 was a time when girls got married after high school, same-sex relationships were seen as unnatural and the Red Scare paranoia constantly threatened the livelihood of the Chinese community. And Lo does a wonderful job of weaving these societal constructs into the intersectionality of Lily’s identity, our 17-year-old Chinese American protagonist. Much to her mother and her best friend’s disappointment, Lily is not interested in finding a boyfriend and getting married. She wants to continue her education in STEM like her Aunt Judy, a human-computer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. She wants to go to the Telegraph Club and see Tommy Andrews, a male impersonator. And as she develops feelings for her classmate, Kath, we see her discovering her sexual identity — one that is in direct opposition to her image of a “good Chinese girl”. Because a “good Chinese girl” is not queer and definitely not a Communist. Lo delicately examines Lily’s struggles with self-identity as a queer woman against the Chinese community’s struggles with combating xenophobia, and in turn, highlights the issue that every immigrant and person of color deals with — fitting in. A beautiful story about self-discovery, first loves, and found family, this novel gives voice to those lost in history—queer Asian American women.CW: sexism, misogyny, xenophobia, racism, racial slurs, deportation, death of a loved one, homophobia, mention of miscarriageThank you to Penguin Teen for the gifted finished copy. All opinions are my own.   i really REALLY enjoyed this book. i had been seing it everywhere on bookstagram for the past few months and as everyone hyped it up, i decided to give it a try :') and ofc, it lived up to my expectations.the book is set in the 1950s in chinatown, where we follow a chinese teenage girl named lily while she slowly finds out she is a lesbian and very much in love with kath, one of her classmates for years. they got to a lesbian club every other night till the police raids it and both of them have to make serious decisions about their lives from now on... the author used terms and slurs which were relevant back then but are quite outdated and even offensive nowadays. although i do understand why she used “oriental” to refer to lily and her chinese family and “caucasian” to refer to kath and other white people, i could not help but feel slightly awkward. i do not like the word “caucasian” bc to me it's monolithic and non geographically/ethnically correct. anyways, malinda lo ofc stated that she only used the terms for historical accuracy but i could not quite get used to it.other than that, i really loved that lily was in love with space and wanted to go and study and work in the making of a spacecraft while kath loved aeroplanes and wanted to become a pilot. their dreams were so unique and precious to me. anyways, i found really cute and pure how they slowly fell in love and fought against all odds. i won't spoil what happens in the end bc you have to read it yourselves *winks*  "It was about two women." Lily's mouth felt so dry she might choke on the words. "That book, Strange Season. It was about two women, and they fell in love with each other." And then she asked the question that had taken root in her, that was even now unfurling its leaves and demanding to be shown the sun: "Have you ever heard of such a thing?"I've heard so much about this book, so naturally, I was really excited to finally read it. Being inside Lily's head as she's trying to figure out her sexuality is so real and vivid. I could feel her grow as a character as the book went on, warring with her need to be a good Chinese daughter, and to be part of the world of the Telegraph Club with Kath. Lo has painted a vivid picture of 1954 Chinatown that had me completely engrossed. I especially liked the timelines throughout the book as they helped to center the story--Lily's story--around national and international events as well as familial events. And the few brief sections from her mother and aunt's perspective helped to show what was expected of Chinese women. I guess after all the build up of this book, I was expecting to be completely blown away. And it's not to say that I wasn't, but also, it wasn't as lifechanging as expected. Still well worth the read, because I don't know enough about the 1950s, apparently. Lo makes that quite clear in the author's note, and for that, and the insight into life as a questioning/lesbian teen in the 1950s, this read was worth it.   In the author’s note, Malinda Lo said she wanted to write a story that celebrated being Chinese American and a lesbian “in spaces that often do not allow both to coexist.” Mission accomplished. I was completely charmed by this genre-busting novel set in 1950s San Francisco, amid the Red Scare and anti-homosexuality sentiment. Lo leveraged history in a meaningful way to address intersectionality and the experiences of people, like 17-year-old Lily Hu, who often found themselves in the margins among peers, family and society. History often only acknowledges the contributions of white, cis-gendered men – and queer history is no different. I appreciate that Lo used “Telegraph” as an outlet to bring forward queer Asian American history. Honestly, even if you’re not interested in this novel at least read the author’s notes, which is a Cliff’s Notes treasure trove of information about Chinese language, the political and social realities of 1950s America and San Francisco, Chinese immigration and assimilation in the United States and, of course, lesbian history.While there are many heavy themes and topics discussed in “Telegraph,” it’s also a sweet coming of age story. My main complaints: it is predictable and a tad long. Up until the end, Lo had done a good job balancing multiple storylines, but some plots – specifically the flashbacks with her parents and aunt – felt unfinished. Also, the final chapters, while authentic for the 1950s, were not satisfying.  Narrated by Emily Woo Zeller, she did a great job of balancing Lily’s innocence and naivety with the realities that begin to change life as she knows it. I particularly enjoyed her performance as Tommy Andrews, a male impersonator who is a key player in Lily’s sexual awakening.  3.5 stars, rounded upI was so so disappointed by this,,, I thought it was going to be one of my favourite books ever because the blurb was doing everything it needed to but the book itself just wasn't it for me. I really loved the discussion of Asian American queer identity in the 1950s and thought that the historical elements were really interesting - it was clear the author had done her research! However, from the blurb, I thought it was going to be focused more on these historical aspects, which is why I picked up the book, but instead we were stuck inside Lily's head thinking about her relationship which had no chemistry until they made out (I mean, it was a brilliant make-out scene, but still). I failed to connect with Lily at all as a main character. She was inoffensive, but it also felt as though she had barely any personality - I would have much rather read about Shirley or Judy, because they both seemed like much more interesting characters, but there were so many side characters that I struggled to keep track of them all and some of them seemed irrelevant. Overall, this book was pretty frustrating, because it had a lot of potential that it just didn't follow through on. It got better in the last 100 pages but unfortunately it didn't save the rest of the book and the writing style just wasn't for me a lot of the time, even if it was objectively good. However, it was sapphic, so it gets bonus points for that - would probably still recommend hesitantly because everyone else seems to love this but I'm definitely not this book's biggest fan.  this book is everything Lily slowly discovering her sexuality is so realistic. Also, the descriptions of scenes are so vivid and rich, they make me feel like I was there in 1950s San Franciso?? The writer threads an underlying tension and anxiety through the book very well, which is perfectly fitting as being a lesbian in the 1950s was difficult and fear-inducing.The book left me feeling hopeful and proud. I felt so bad for all the shit they had to put up with, but I was hella proud of Lily and Kath, and by extension those who came before us and paved the way. Lily was a character I genuinely liked; she is true to herself even when it costs her, and knows what she wants very well. She has inner strength that carried her even through the blatant homophobia and racism she was facing. The story made me feel hopeful that things will change, and appreciative that now, we at least have some representation that doesn't depict lesbians as insane, committing suicide or turning straight.I wish the book was longer!! and had more of Kath's perspective as we don't know much about her. Would have loved to see more of her journey. Also, I wish the end of the book hadn't come about so abruptly and there was more about how the conflicts were resolved. I could have read 300 more pages.Love the Chinese and Cantonese words which I could half-understand, they were familiar and comforting. Also, the butch and femme representation was unexpected but completely welcome and lovely. Did this book just make me type a long review for once?? Wow  Very nicely done book about a girl coming of age and discovering her gayness. Lily, a high school senior in San Francisco's Chinatown, has been brought up to be a dutiful Chinese-American daughter. It's the '50s, so she's expected to fit into the stereotyped female role. Her family is educated and forward-thinking for the times, so she gets to like math and science fiction and aspire to be a computer for JPL. But as she discovers her attraction to women (butch women!), she knows that it's way outside the boundaries of acceptable. (I was born 13 years later than Lily, and I never even heard of gay men until college, and gay women still later. Yes, SF was different, but...if you were gay back then, it must have taken a lot of chutzpah to figure it all out.)Besides all that, the book takes on the casual sexism and racism of the times. At the lesbian club, Lily is the only Asian person, and everyone comments on it ("We rarely see Orientals here" and calling her "China doll"). Similar things happen pretty much whenever she ventures outside Chinatown. Then there's the Communist scare and witch hunt, which affects Lily's physician father. All the themes are interwoven nicely. Though it's a young adult book, it's written for a fairly sophisticated reader. There's high school drama (Lily's best friend is a self-centered queen bee who can be nice but also can be a problem), and Lily can be avoidant of making herself clear (she tries to ignore the fact that her male friend has a crush on her). But Lily is feeling her way into becoming who she is, and she does that steadily. I could relate to her shyness and also to her determination.  Last Night at the Telegraph Club is a Queer, historical fiction novel about the coming-of-age of Lily Hu, a Chinese-American, 17-year-old living in 1950’s San Francisco. This literally checked all of my boxes, so I had to get on it! This is a story about friendship, finding your own voice, family obligations and first love.Malindo Lo takes us on a tour from San Francisco’s Chinatown, to the Lesbian scene on Telegraph Ave. Lo has given us a thoroughly researched novel about that time period, and what it meant to be Queer, as well as the Anti-Chinese sentiments that arose as a result of the Red Scare and McCarthyism; and she did it with so much care, that it makes my heart swell.I loved Lily. I loved how much she grew throughout the novel, I loved the glimpses into the past of her parents and especially her Aunt Judy. I loved that Lo included Chinese characters in her writing when the characters spoke or thought primarily in Chinese. I loved Kath. I wanted more Kath. But this was very much a novel about Lily. Her hopes and dreams, her not wanting to disappoint her parents, her unraveling friendship with her best friend, Shirley; but it was ultimately about Lily figuring out her own truth and finding her voice.This was small glimpse, a year really, into the life of Lily. There were some things that I wish Lo would have expanded on, and many more things that weren’t necessarily “wrapped up” in the end, things that I initially questioned, but then I remembered, this was a different time; and so many of the struggles that Lily dealt with, that this novel explored, are still, to this day, some of the struggles that the Queer community faces, as well as the Asian-American community.   Solid, well-written YA. Interesting set-up and context exploring what it was like to be Chinese in the US in the 1950s, as well as lesbian culture and community at the time and how the two identities might intersect. I appreciated the notes at the end of the book explaining the context and giving a list of references too.Despite being very different in many ways, it reminded me quite a lot of Tipping the Velvet. It could be purely to do with how strongly the protagonist is drawn to a male impersonator, but it's probably also to do with her development over the course of the book from being timid and confused about her identity and the world she's entering, to an INCREDIBLY assured character with a firm sense of self, and Lo manages to make it feel authentic which is no mean feat.However, the actual plot of the book was ostensibly a love story, but that fell a bit flat for me. The love interest, Kath, was just not developed enough as a character - I got to the end of the book and felt like I still had no idea who she really was as a person. This makes the romance much less convincing and it was heavily reliant on "then Lily realised she was in love with her"-type statements in the narration to move the relationship along. Bizarrely, Kath was the only character for whom I really felt this was an issue - the best friend Shirley by contrast was a very interesting complex character. It made it very clear that Kath and the romance were only there as a vehicle through which Lily discovers her sexuality and identity and is introduced to the lesbian scene. In itself that's not an issue but I just think regardless of your reasoning for it, if you're going to make your main plot a romance then you need a bit more commitment to the romance.  I wanted to absolutely love this book so, so, so badly, but the execution didn't work for me. The representation, the setting, the premise, the everything was SO compelling. But the first half of this book was a struggle to get through (I had to borrow it from the library twice because I couldn't get through it the first time), and the way the timeline hops around is really unnecessary and disorienting. It's a choppy book and even the chapters are often unnecessarily short.That said, Malinda Lo put her heart and soul into this book. It's so authentic and heartfelt, and I'll even forgive her for dragging my very American love of char siu bao because it's literally what my cousin does. Not to mention her section at the end delving into her historical research, the overlooked women who inspired her, and even a bibliography—all of which was just as fascinating as the book itself. Maybe more! The sheer amount of love and care written into this book is incredible.However, the choppy writing never landed for me and I felt like this book never fully lived up to its potential. I'm glad that I shrugged off my feelings about Ash ("well, I was also a worse writer a decade ago, so"), because I really enjoyed this book. I'm still a little bummed that this wasn't the 5-star knock-out I dreamed of, but it was still a great read.  This certainly covered a pre-stonewall era that i know very little about, as well as the beginning of the cold war and america’s obsessed-fear of communism. reading it through the eyes of young girl from an author who obviously researched it incredibly well and was inspired by her own family’s experience drove it home.it’s also important to point out that i am a 23 year old white woman and this book depicts the experience of a 17 year old chinese american girl - i can neither comment nor “rate” her experiences.i haven’t read a book from the perspective of a teenager in several months, so that took some getting used to. i do, however, understand the absolute terror of realising you’re not straight and first loves (did not happen at the same time for me as it does with lily and kath but ya. i Got that.)i enjoyed this book. i didn’t love it, but i did like it. i liked and sympathied with lily. i dipsied shirley, her hypocrisy and the homophobic language being tossed around. i understood the conflict of lily falling in love with a girl and what that could mean for her father being deported. that doesn’t mean i agreed with them kicking her out and even offering conversion therapy.aunt judy was sweet. i wish we could have seen more of her and lily’s relationship when lily moved in with her and her uncle. se siente como un abracito al corazón. sobre descubrirte y existir rodeada de “valores” en los que no cabes: saber que lo que tu instinto te dice está mal, la pena, el pensar que después pasa, la negación y también el dejarte llevar y sentir que ahí perteneces, aunque no sepas que es ahí. me dio mucha ternura y me vi cuando lily se guarda la imagen de tommy, esa sensación de querer estar cerca y no. me hizo recordar mucho las veces que vi a parejas lésbicas y dije wow, existen y es algo que no estoy imaginando. cuando lana recibe a lily en su depa me lloraron los ojos porque me recuerda a todas mis amigas que me abrieron su depa cuando solo podía llorar y me abrazaron fuerte.cuando hablan de sus primeros amores, de cómo vivieron ser queer con sus familias, fuck, hits deep, y, de alguna forma me sentí acompañada.igual que chingue a su padre mccarthy, los policías, estados unidos y todo. te muestra sutil pero tajantemente el racismo y la lesbofobia que había en 1950, y que todavía hay.llore muchísimo el final, pero también durante el epílogo, saberlas juntas, amándose, en san francisco me lleno el corazoncito.la autora escribe súper suave y describe todo muy bien. no se si es que i relate too much a una morra de 17 en 1950 o está tan bien escrito que no se siente taaaanto la diferencia.  I highly recommend this book. It expertly explores the social constraints of 1950s America as Lily moves from her quiet and obedient childhood into an adulthood in which she is determined to seek out her own place in the world, no matter the limitations she has discovered that are fighting to hold her back. The book is clearly well-researched, and Lo does a spectacular job helping the reader understand the historical context in which the story is set. She gives us glimpses of how the Red Scare impacted the LGBTQIA and Chinese American communities. She also cleverly injects early hints of the dawning of American space exploration through Lily’s fascination with the universe and her aspirations to be part of that forward momentum. Lily is an intelligent 17-year-old Chinese American girl who begins to immerse herself in the lesbian community of 1950s San Francisco. Neither her Chinatown community nor her lesbian community are fully accepting of the other, and thus she is left to balance these two cornerstones of her identity and tries to search for a sense of belonging among her family, childhood friends, and a new friend who loves math as much as she does. I thoroughly enjoyed this read. Lily is quite a compelling character as she navigates her troubles against the backdrop of Lo’s thoroughly researched 1950s San Francisco.   This book is phenomenal, in every sense of the word. I finished it over an hour ago, but that feeling I had through out this week when I was still reading it, still lingers and I don't think it'll really leave me for days. For the entire time I was not reading this, I could not stop thinking about it. It's not an easy book for me to review/give my thoughts about. I felt a deep connection with the main character since the first page, and for every single thing Lily Hu had gone through in this book, I deeply felt and cared for her. The topics discussed in this book are hard, and triggering even for me, so please do check out the trigger warnings first before reading it. I also have no complain over the writing. Every time I picked this book up again, I immediately felt immersed to the story, which in this case, was sometimes not a good thing because there was this feeling of hollowness, pain and anxiousness that kind of escaped in me during some part of the book. Things I love about this book: how I loved the fact that you can feel the love seeping through the pages. We were introduced to three stories in this: Lily's, Lily's mom Grace Hu, and her aunt Judy. Even though Lily's one is definitely the main story here, I really liked Grace's and Judy's ones and how they kind of intertwine with Lily's. So yeah, the review on the cover of this wasn't wrong. This book could be for anyone who has ever loved, in every sense of the word. Also I liked how there's so many history written into this, as seen in the author's notes at the end of this book. Anyway in conclusion of this rant, I will be thinking about this book for a lot of days, weeks, and years to come.   Last Night at the Telegraph Club by Malinda Lo is an enchanting historical fiction read about a young Chinese girl discovering and growing into her queerness in Chinatown in 1950s San Francisco. Lily has always felt small glimmers of it, but it's only when classmate Kath brings her to the Telegraph Club to see male impersonator Tommy Andrews perform that the question deep within her blossoms to the surface. But it's a dangerous time to be queer—the fear of communism is at a high, and her father has already come under suspicion. And how can Lily possibly confide in her over-bearing, bold best friend Shirley?This young adult novel is engaging and immersive. Lo dips into the struggles of Lily and her heritage, of her goals of building rockets and becoming one of the early women involved in the quest to go to space, inspired by her Aunt Judy, who works as a calculator. Kath wants to be a pilot; Shirley is at once traditional and wistful in her desires. It's an excellent look into the community of queer women in the 1950s, from its freedoms to its dangers. Lily was the perfect character to guide us through this world—shy, wanting to make her family proud, not wanting to disturb the peace, but also curious, with an inner determination and longing to be who she is. It was a quick, romantic tale about being gay in an unaccepting world.I received a copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review. Last Night at the Telegraph Club is out now from Dutton Books for Young Readers.  "Haven't you ever wondered what it would be like to have nothing keeping you attached to the ground?"Last Night at the Telegraph Club by Malinda Lo is more than just a story of two girls who fell in love in a time where homosexuality is seen as an immoral act. It's also a story of grasping and figuring out your identity even when the odds are stacked against you.When I bought this book, I knew right off the bat that I'm going to love it. The chapters were short and it was written in a way that truly transports you back in time (which is important for historical fiction, in my opinion). I also loved how there were two POVs from different timelines, showing the old ways and the new ones. I've been to San Francisco twice, and whenever a place I've been to is mentioned in the book, it makes me love it more!I'm not gonna lie, there were parts that threw me off guard. But after reading the author's note, I understood why those were written that way. Overall, this was a good read and I wish more people would pick this up (especially since this month is also AAPI Heritage Month)!Read this book if you love: Historical fiction, Sapphic and Asian rep, coming-of-age stories, and women in STEM  Rating: 4 StarsThis is a case of really enjoying the story, the characters, the narrative, but not enjoying the writing much. I love YA, but I occasionally feel like the author is trying to "dumb down" the writing style to attract YA readers, and I feel like this book may have hit that mark. That being said, I am clearly not a teenager anymore, so it could actually be right on level for what they want to read in terms of dialogue and description... it just fell a bit flat for me.But I did give it four stars because I thought the story was wonderful. The narrative interwove gender and sexuality with immigration issues so beautifully, and I though this book was an excellent example of showing that novels can be more than one thing, and do all those things well. I enjoyed the characters and the roles they played in Lily's life -- it felt very realistic and reminiscent of my childhood, even though I didn't deal with any of the issues Lily is dealing with.Anyway, definitely a good book, even if I did roll my eyes at the writing every now and then, and I think it was a story worth telling.Who Should Read It: Anyone wanting to learn more about early lesbian culture. Anyone looking for a story with depth.  “She’s having a hard time right now because you’re not what she expected. But we’re never what our parents expected. They have to learn that lesson.” ~4.25Finally got the time to sit down and read this!! I had a bit of trouble getting interested in the story in the beginning. I mostly read fantasy and can have a hard time with anything else. But after about 100 pages I fell into a rhythm. The writing flows easily and the plot picks up just enough to keep you turning the page. The atmosphere Malinda Lo creates for San Francisco in the 1950s is amazing. You can clearly tell they put time and research into it. From the descriptions of the food to the political climate everything was done in such detail. The romance in this book is sweet and new and exciting. It perfectly captures how it feels to be with your first love. Malinda Lo writes about the struggles of being lgbtq+ as well as being an Asian American women in the 1950s as an own voice writer. I really enjoyed reading her perspective on the intersection of these different communities. I recommend giving this book a read if you like historical romances with an amazing atmosphere!!  Malinda Lo’s latest work, Last Night At The Telegraph Club, is superb young/new adult fiction. The novel is set in Chinatown in the 1950’s. Lily Hu’s life is a Venn Diagram of contradicting expectations. There is her Chinese heritage and traditions on one end and patriotism and being American on the other. There is the norm that after high school she will marry and have children and her desire to go to college and become a rocket scientist. And a new struggle that she is slowly becoming aware of: people’s assumptions that she is interested in guys and her realization that she is attracted to women.This is the 1950’s where the Red-Scare is a serious threat to her family; the fear of deportation lingers over them like a cloud even though they are all U.S. citizens. This is the 1950’s where gay and lesbian peoples had to carve out their own hangouts but face harassment, arrests, and false charges from police. This is a young woman whose desires and self-identity are being thwarted by all of the authority figures around her. This is a story of adolescence of a young girl in the 1950’s whose feelings, frustrations, and confusion as to where one belong rings true in any decade.I love Lily Hu. I love this book. I hope you do too.John G  2022 reading goal: read a sapphic novel.I had to do some thinking about what I wanted to rate this book - and in the end landed on a solid 3. I loved the story and I think the plot was excellent. I connected with Lily and Kath, and I would read more books about them...maybe (if written by a different author). There were some things in this book that bothered me!First, the flashbacks did not work for me. I understand what the author was trying to do, but they took me out of the action and they weren't interesting.Second, the writing style drove me nuts! There were so many words that ended with "y" and "ly" and even more than 50% of the characters' names ended in "y" - WHY?! All I could see was y y y y y y y and it was driving me mad. This might not bother other readers, but I found it distracting. The adverbs, to me, were a sign of a weak writer (sorry, not sorry). Throw me some metaphors and clean this story up and it would have been a standout!I actually liked the writing style of the author's note at the end - the nonfiction part of the book better. (Maybe she should try to write nonfiction?!?)  3.5This historical fiction book is set in 1950s in San Francisco following a young Chinese American girl as she discovers her identity as a lesbian and how there is no place in this world for a Chinese American and lesbian.This author really did her research from using different Chinese dialects to historical landmarks and times. I really appreciated that and it really made the setting come to life. The characters were interesting however I found at times things were overly descriptive and I would start to get a little bored.The characters were very well done. There was a wide variety of them and I really enjoyed the relationship between Kath and Lily. The ending was bittersweet it wasn’t a perfect ending but I also wasn’t a pile of tears on the floor.I don’t think this book is for everyone, but I really appreciate the highlight of the LGBTQ community and the things that they faced in the 1950s. These are people alive today and some who are still struggling to find a place in this world. The struggles that Lily face discovering who she is while also struggling to find a place as a Chinese in America was very well done in this book.   4.5 Stars. Read this book for a book club.I have a little mixed feelings about this book. I really liked the book overall. I finished the book relatively quickly and was an easy read overall.I guess I wanted more from certain parts and less from others. There was kind of a lull in the middle of the book. Although I think I understand where author, Malinda Lo, was intending in doing with the background chapters of Lily's parents and aunt, it often felt unnecessary to the story. I instead would have preferred more insight into Kath's life. Kath's character felt very underdeveloped and mysterious to me. It felt almost like a vague interpretation of someone's idea of a queer character?? Idk I knew nothing about her except for her liking Planes lmaooo.This also was a little YA fiction to me, and we all know I am a YA hater- I am a ripe 24 years old, YA stopped impressing me in freshman year of high school.Big surprise though, I really enjoyed it (and I think the historical fiction parts saved it).The setting of SF/chinatown really made this book for me. When characters live in a city it typically takes place in NYC or LA so it was refreshing and almost profoundly personal to read about it in SF, a place close to home :)  You know when you read a book and it's a great story but it's so overwritten that it detracts from the experience? Sadly, that happened here. There's a lot of repetition. A lot. Of repetition. Like a lot of repetition. A Chinese American high school student from San Francisco becomes infatuated with a male impersonator. She ventures into the late-night underworld of queer culture and starts making choices that alienate her from her conservative friends and family's expectations. It's the 1950s, and the Red Scare is also going on. Lo had a lot to work with. In listening to the authors note, I came to believe she's a very analytical individual and that really shows in her writing. There were some plot elements that could have been explored to make this more compelling, especially concerning Lily's Chinese-born father and the way the government manipulated stand-up citizens to further their agenda. That being said, Lo's descriptions of San Francisco were freaking spectacular! I felt like I was there and really enjoyed the trip to my old hometown. Also, it got a little steamy and her sex scene was very well executed. And since we read historical fiction to learn, I discovered that publishing used to have a rule where if you portrayed a homosexual character, they had to face punishment at the end of the book. I guess we've come a long way baby?  omg !! i loved this book! i felt a deep emotional connection surrounding the gayness in this book and all the feelings that come with being gay. there were so many one liners i related to like how lily (the main character) asked if it meant something about playing a boy in a school play, or the way the author described the sweetness and deepness of queer love and people! the way the author wrote about these unique yet broad experiences in the queer community was amazing. i cried a lot thinking about the history and culture the book explored and how the bravery of so many queer people in the past have led to where we are and where i am today at times i didn’t like where the story was headed and i wanted more! and i still don’t know how to feel about the open to interpretation of the ending vibe, i know it’s more realistic than a normal ya ending book, and it’s just life. my heart aches at the characters and the history and thinking of the story in general for that reason and my emotions i want to give it five starsmaybe i’m just getting my period soon but wow ! gay panic and yearning sums up my vibe of this book lmao  Wow this book.I highly recommend. Lily is a teenager Asian American in the 1950s, living in Chinatown in San Francisco. She sees a picture of a male impersonator and cant get the image out of her head. The male impersonator sings at a known lesbian bar called The Telegraph Club. Lily meets a girl, Kath, who has been to the club before, so they begin to sneak out at night to go there. And so the story unfolds ...This book is about family, about community, about white privilege, about the truth of yourself, about accepting yourself. It focuses on her being a "good Chinese girl" and the expectations that label comes with, and how she refuses to lie about who she is. This book made me grateful for all of the gay people who came before me who made it possible for me to walk through the streets holding my wife's hand. For me to have a wife! This is an amazing read, really showing the perseverance of love and the desperation of wanting to be accepted. It can be heart-wrenching, but also heartwarming. It will keep you up way past your bedtime. But it's all worth it.  4.5 starsWith a 1950s backdrop that adds its own complex societal issues into the mix, Last Night at the Telegraph Club is more than just a love story. What I loved about this book is the layered plot - we watch two girls fall in love while also exploring the importance of connection, family, identity and friendship. The characters are also well developed and whether we were sitting in the club, dancing in a living room or lounging around in the park, I felt like I was right there alongside these women.Lily is the sweetest lead ever and her inner turmoil gave great context to the world and the time she was living in. Watching her come into her own, realise it was okay to disrupt the norm and fall head over heels for Kath was such a beautiful reading experience. Kath was equally as adorable and I loved watching these two grow closer. I would've loved if the ending was built out a bit more because I really wanted to see what their future looked like, but I also can’t deny it still put a smile on my face. If you love a contemporary romance, great character work and you’re just looking to read something that gets you in your feels, don’t pass up Last Night at the Telegraph Club.Side note: I did not care for her best friend Shirley at all. She's the worst.  Der Erfahrungen des 2.Weltkrieges haben Spuren in der Bevölkerung hinterlassen. Aber auch die aufkeimende Angst vorm Kommunismus und die Bar-Razzien sorgen für Unruhen im San Francisco der 1954er Jahre. Im Telegraph Club finden die 17-jährige Lily Hu und ihre Freundin Kath Miller Zuflucht. Doch nicht nur das, denn Lily eröffnet sich dort eine vollkommen neue Welt. Gemeinsam mit Kath findet sie endlich Antworten auf die Fragen die ihr im Kopf herumschwirren. Malinda Lo berichtet von einer noch nicht lange vergangenen Zeit und dem Leben derer, die unter den Teppich der Geschichte gekehrt wurden. Die Ereignisse sind gut recherchiert und fabelhaft mit den fiktiven Anteilen der Geschichte verflochten. Lilys Reise auf dem Weg zur Entdeckung ihrer Queer-Identität und der Entwicklung ihrer Identität als chinesische amerikanische junge Frau ist toll dargestellt und interessant zu verfolgen. Vor allem, da dies zu einer Zeit geschieht in der beides gesellschaftlich nicht toleriert wurde. Auch Lilys Erkundung des lesbischen Barszene und die Art wie die Autorin dies mit dem erblühen der ersten Liebe verbunden hat ist absolut wunderbar. Lo´s Schreibstil gibt der Geschichte ebenfalls viel. Er ist detailliert, einfühlsam und angenehm zu lesen. "Last Night at the Telegraph Club" ist ein absolut wundervolles Buch! Ich habe nicht nur durch die Geschichte selbst, sondern auch durch die ausführliche Anmerkung der Autorin am Schluss sehr viel erfahren. Eine wirklich traurige aber auch wunderschöne Geschichte über das Erwachsenwerden in einer Gesellschaft die noch viel zu lernen hat.  This was really good! A story focusing on a Chinese American discovering her sexuality while navigating a post-WWII world where most Chinese families were being suspected of communism. The characters were written really realistically - I felt like Lily was completely relatable. I also liked the slow burn of her relationship with Kath. (Sorry if I'm not spelling names correctly because I listened to the audiobook.)I did want a little more of the Communism plotline because I thought that was going to go somewhere and it ultimately didn't. Maybe that was the point - just to have that feeling lingering there as many of the Chinese families did in that time - but I was just hoping for a little more.I also really liked the author's detailed notes at the end to show where each part came from and its relation to deal events in history. I'm not the target demographic for this book (I'm neither Chinese nor a lesbian), but I think this is one of those books that someone needing this representation will find some relief in. I'm happy this book exists because I know there are some people out there who are going to feel really seen by it.  What a gorgeous, layered read. Although it’s many things, (a trip to 1950s San Francisco, an examination of what it means to grow up as Chinese American, a commentary on young women in STEM,) Last Night at the Telegraph Club is first and foremost, an ode to women. Lily Hu is seventeen and in her senior year of high school; she’s beginning to think of the future, her future. As she looks at a career in science more seriously, despite the teasing and discouragement of her friends, she gets to know a girl from her math class: Kathleen Miller. As friendship blooms between the two girls, so too does Lily’s awareness of her own sexuality. I did find that the book covered a lot of topics and themes, and maybe even tried to be too many things. I thought the chapters that focused on Lily’s parents’ history felt unnecessary, and dragged things down. I thought the undercurrent of fear surrounding the Red Scare, and the resulting racism, wasn’t ever really properly addressed. It was an interesting plot line that never went anywhere. The descriptions of San Francisco were fun, but the minute detailing of intersections and streets were a bit much, especially for a reader who isn’t from the area.However, none of this detracted from the main heart of this book: Lily and Kath’s story. Every scene with them absolutely sang. Lo’s writing is very nuanced, and each exchange between Lily and Kath is filled with rich subtlety. So much of Lily’s internal doubt; the way she sees women, the way she questions herself, then awakens to it, is so beautifully written. It’s classified as YA, but the writing and tone are so sophisticated; I’d easily recommend it to any adult. I found Last Night at the Telegraph Club to be a bit of an uneven read, but overall, shimmering and gorgeous and important.  
  "Are you like the girl in the book, too? Because I think I am."
Have you misplaced your feelings? If so, this book will find them FOR you! So many feelings...I adored Lily. Not only is she not quite sure what it means that she's attracted to other women, she has no one to ask. Her family are traditional and she can't figure out what she's trying to say, anyway...WHICH IS USUALLY THE ISSUE.This book made me feel sadness, anger, heartbreak, empowerment, disgust, indignity, sorrow, fear, hope, pining, love. It features a queer girl from Chinatown who only wants to do math and loves rockets. She is an anachronism, and it's such a shame.Reading this made me, more than anything, respect the generations that came before me. The ladies that had to hide their relationships and use a slew of code words just to love who they were naturally attracted to. Homosexuality was still considered a mental disorder and same-sex intercourse was outlawed. It was never not dangerous.Now add that in to a conservative, Chinese-American family during the Red Scare where your neighbor could report that you're a communist and you'd get taken away...Hats off to the ladies.  This book is a champion. Malinda Lo is giving realistic fiction in the best sense-- it's well situated within its historical context, without being too fact-y about it and without denying the storyline anything; the characters and plot details were just right. It avoids all the YA writing tropes I dislike and leaned into its own restraint (think: I have no clue what the mc Lily's room looks like, because it simply does not matter to the story! but I do know how she's feeling and what drives each of her actions) and all the hesitation and fumbling of being a shy "newly" gay teenager. I love that the ending isn't big or splashy, it follows the story's true trajectory. REALISTIC FICTION FINERY. Lastly I think Lo did an amazing job weaving in all sorts of intersecting issues-- period-specific racism, homophobia, sexism, asian immigration, and McCarthyism-era mentalities, SO well. Lo is no pedant and that is why I love this also if anyone wants to read this so we can talk about it hmu babey  *Read for Teen Lit class*It’s been a while since I’ve read a historical fiction, so it was a nice change of pace to be able to read this one. The way Malinda Lo writes is immediately transportive and I could picture myself in the 1950s San Francisco scene. The writing style is quite lovely, but after discussing it in teen lit class, there could’ve been more character development for the characters other than Lily. I feel like the only other character who was really developed a lot was Shirley, and not even Kath, the love interest. All I remember about her is that she likes airplanes and is really smart. However, Lily and Katy’s romance was well-developed in my opinion. It had all the excitement and fear that comes with first love. There was also a minor subplot that I felt could’ve been resolved, but that’s okay, it’s not that big of a deal. Other than those few things, I definitely recommend this read to anyone who wants a historically accurate, beautifully written book about first love. ☞ 3 stars (liked it)  5 StarsYet another 5* read for August. I have been blessed.I love a modern historical novel done well, and this was certainly that. Main character Lily grapples with both her ethnicity and sexuality in this story, and this is explored via her relationships with her crush Kathleen, her parents, her extended family, her fellow Chinese-American friends and other queer women. We actually get some POV chapters from family members of Lily's, which I really enjoyed.The setting of 1950s San Francisco felt well-researched and realised - this is one of those books where you truly feel transported back in time, the atmosphere is so strong. The author's note at the end is also well worth a read - a lot of the language and terminology used in the book is 1950s era appropriate, and Malindo Lo goes into her thought processes behind that in her writing and how queer identities differ today (e.g. re: the gender binary or lack thereof). She also talks about her research for the novel more generally, in a lot of detail. A very interesting read!While Last Night at the Telegraph Club is categorised as YA, and that isn't incorrect, it more so falls into that bildungsroman, coming-of-age genre that fits perfectly between YA and adult, The Perks of Being a Wallflower being the first other book of that particular category to come to mind. The writing is sophisticated and while there is tension and some drama in the story, especially near the end, the angst and melodrama you'd typically find in books that are more conventional YA contemporary aren't there. It's a quieter, more subtle story and I'd more quickly recommend it to readers of adult contemporary and historical fiction than those who are in the mood for more mainstream YA tropes and storylines. However, there's enough overlap that I think most YA readers would enjoy this too, so long as they're down for a slower-paced, very character-driven story with not much plot.Anyway, I really loved this book! Looking forward to reading Lo's next one (thanks for the arc, Netgalley!).  c’est un superbe roman sur une histoire d’amour lesbienne pendant la montée de la peur rouge.je me tourne rarement vers des romans historiques pour diverses raisons, mais la romance m’a fait aller au-delà de celles-ci. j’ai aimé l’écriture, les personnages de lily et kath, la culture chinoise dont je ne connais somme toute pas grand chose et la forme en général. la façon dont le roman est découpé m’a plu : les frises chronologiques mêlant événements personnels et historiques, les chapitres du point de vue des adultes qui gravitent autour de lily, et dans l’ensemble les chapitres très courts qui marquent l’instant. on passe les 200 premières pages à voir se mettre en place la chute, puis dans les 100 dernières, ce qu’on devine des le début finit par arriver. j’ai versé quelques larmes dès les premiers chapitres, puis je me suis retrouvée à pleurer tout ce que je pouvais pleurer à la cafète en lisant les 20 derniers d’une traite. bien que récent, ce roman n’est pas sans évoquer la nécessité d’une mémoire queer, dans laquelle je compte dès à présent me plonger en partie grâce à ce livre.  The most refreshing and tender part of this story for me was that every time Lily Hu could choose to lie and make herself small to protect herself and her family from her truth, Malinda Lo chose to write a different way of living for Lily. This moved me, considering how much of your life you can spend lying to yourself and others to get by. These exchanges were very meaningful to me.I want to meet every asian american lesbian ever and hug them so so so tight and tell them I love them. Ancestors, let’s go swimming in the cosmic bay waters of kinship!!!Side note is that nothing will ever top my experience of walking into a queer bar for the first time and seeing red paper lanterns hanging from the ceiling…my body could not handle the clash of realities, everything melted and suddenly i was a discombobulated puddle on the sidewalk trying to remember how to breathe. This is so vastly different from the experience of those before me. I figure if I ever get to tell them this story, they might laugh ruefully and unbottle a life’s worth of smirk.  Esse livro foi um nocaute imprevisto. O modo como a autora narra a hesitação, o medo, o desejo e o encanto de Lily ao descobrir sobre lesbianidade e espaços de sociabilidade lésbica é tão vivo, tem tanto do redemoinho de emoções que a gente sente quando é adolescente. Acho que o principal pra mim foi a sensorialidade da escrita: o gosto da primeira cerveja, o choque visual de tantas mulheres juntas em um só lugar, seus cheiros e calores aquecendo a pele, a sensação eletrizante da proximidade intocável da moça que vc gosta - e então seu hálito quente no rosto. Já falei aqui, tbm foi muito potente ler sobre como ela lida com a vergonha. Anos 50 e o mundo, a polícia, os pais dizendo que isso é imoral, doentio, errado. Mas o regozijo, a excitação, e a beleza do afeto por amigas e pela moça que ama são tão poderosos que deslocam e marginalizam a vergonha cada vez mais. A força dessas personagens, a convicção que sentem por sua comunidade e umas pelas outras curou algo dentro de mim.  This book was great. I loved it so much. I’m so happy I’ve finally read this after putting it off for so long. I guess I was worried it wouldn’t be going to live up to my expectations. But I think it actually did. I didn’t really know what to expect of the book, except for it to be good, I’ve only heard good things about it. Yes, I can agree, this book is amazing. The story, connected with Chinatown and homosexuality, in San Francisco in the 1950s, was perfect. I really love historical fiction and this just made me adore it more. There was a lot of talking about politics, primary in China. Much about Communism at that time period. It really had me hooked, I was so interested. The way this story is set up is astonishing. How homosexuality is depicted at these times is something you don’t get to read all the time. It was emotionally draining, but it was so important to show it. Kath and Lily have my heart. They were awesome. The book deserves all the love and praise it’s getting!!   this was wonderful! i don't usually read a ton of historical fiction, but the premise of this was too good to pass up. i'm always looking for more queer stories featuring asian or asian american characters, and this did not disappoint. the blend of culture and discussion of sexuality felt really true to the time period, and lily was such a compelling and interesting protagonist. her relationship with kath was so, so sweet and i was so pleased that they got their happy ending. the issues i had were pretty minor: i felt like the pacing was generally pretty good, but the ending felt a little rushed, and i really would have appreciated more closure with lily and shirley's relationship. they're built up as these longtime friends who've been with each other through so much, and for things to just end the way that they did left me wanting more.overall, such a beautiful, poignant story. excited to read more from this author!   the book was written very thoughtfully and i loved the way Malinda Lo represented and gave voice to queer POCs in the 1950s. loved how the author gave us a glimpse into a piece of forgotten history &amp; the author's note at the end was just a dream. i admired Aunt Judy and Lily (for separate reasons) and loved Lily and Eddie's relationship. obviously a lot of anger for Shirley too. but.... it fell flat for me. i wasn't really compelled enough until the last 50 pages. i get that we were meant to see how confusing it is for Lily but i feel like it could've been done in a more captivating way. wished we got a more in-depth look at Lily and her relationship with Eddie and a more satisfyingly cruel ending to Shirley and Lily's friendship. i wish i loved it more than i do because it was written really really well and i looove Lily. her character was done and crafted really beautifully (and accurately, i feel) and it was amazing to read. but i feel like a lot of things happened but nothing really happened.p.s. i would not refuse an aunt judy-centered book, honestly. what a woman.   What a fantastic book! This historical fiction novel takes place in 1950s San Francisco through the eyes of Lily, a Chinese American teenager who is discovering her sexuality. I loved reading through Lily’s perspective while she explores herself and comes to understand her identities in the context of the various cultures and subcultures she is part of by being lesbian, Chinese American, a teenager, and living in San Francisco in 1954. The novel also gives a glimpse of 1930-50s through the perspectives of Lily’s mother and aunt.I really enjoyed the setting of the Telegraph Club, a fictional lesbian bar in SF. Having recently learned about how few lesbian bars remain in operation today, I was especially struck by the history and importance places like the Telegraph Club were/are for the queer community. The end of the book includes commentary from the author on historical and cultural aspects of the book which were so interesting!I listened to the audiobook narrated by Emily Woo Zeller. The narration was excellent and really brought me into the story.I highly recommend this book!  This book was absolutely brilliant - it did such an amazing job representing so many issues of the day: - what it is like to be a Chinese-American girl growing up in 1950s San Francisco with the threat of deportation due to the global situation- living in an incredibly tight knit and almost claustrophobic community in Chinatown where you have to live by a specific set of rules- a coming of age story and dealing with not only your feelings for other girls, but also how you feel about your friendships with childhood friends - striving to work in an incredibly male dominated field (space travel) Not only was the plot well done, and the characters drawn well, all of these themes were tackled with subtlety and compassion. The main character was laid out to be a very good daughter, bookworm, and the kind friend that would just go along with her more dominant friends. But by the end she is has will of iron, and she is not willing to sacrifice her identity to please her family. As someone who is not a big fan of YA, I think that this book was brilliant, and excellent for adults as well.  I just realized today that I never finished this. When opening it back up, I remembered why - it got very painful at one point, and I was not in a place to actually continue at the time.Today I finished the last 50 pages in one go.What a beautiful, poignant story. I love how Lo takes her time establishing Lily's life, showing her what she was like before, and then the at times confusing, at times brilliantly radiant coming out and romance arc with Kath... only for the inevitable of the times to catch up with them.I am a little sad about the ending, and have deducted a star, because I feel like we deserved to get more story where the author instead opted to skip a year ahead. I would've loved to see Lily's life after the "tragedy".Highly, highly recommend this one to anyone looking for a solid wlw novel!  The coming of age story of an American-Chinese girl set in the 1950's San Francisco, is the crux of the novel. In the post world war period, things were difficult for people in general but for homosexuals it must have been much more.The exclusive club for homosexuals in that era is an achievement of sorts. It shows how such clubs might have been the only free place to be normal for gay/lesbians. The societal and family pressures and the the way to deal with dual life is portrayed so well. When Lily was sent away after she came out as a homosexual, i cannot fathom comparing homosexuality and Communist ideals (being a communist or a supporter of communism was a crime then in America). So I drew parallels between the two. As for the conclusion, i am happy but wanted more out of the story. I'm a strong advocate/believer that we need diverse books; stories that help us learn and understand all people's lives, not just the ones we are familiar with or comfortable with. More stories from other cultures, other religions, POC and LBGTQIA+. This book ticked all those boxes for me. The story is so atmospheric and beautifully set in San Francisco during the Red Scare in the 1950s that I felt like I was actually there. During that time there was lots of paranoia going on with neighbors turning in neighbors for the slightest imagined thing. Lily, who comes from an extremely traditional and very strict family in Chinatown, really needs to watch everything she says and does, as do her entire family. So when she and new friend Kath, and seemingly the only other girl in school interested in science like she is, start secretly going to the Telegraph Club, the underground lesbian bar, they are taking more than a few chances. But that's what you do when you're discovering who you are, fighting to be that person, and fighting to love the person you love. You do it with everything you have, even when you have to fight against tremendous odds. The relationship between Lily and Kath is so sweet and so pure, and also because of the time, so dangerous. My heart ached for them. I just loved, loved, loved, everything about this gorgeous story.  I liked it! I am puzzled by the asides and flashbacks in the book and feel like it doesn’t add much - would have much preferred a focus on Lily throughout. I do also think that the pacing is off (it’s very slow for a very long time and then the end happens so fast??). I also feel like Kath is pretty flat - we don’t get to see that much of her and while I bought in fully to the emotions of that relationship since we’re in Lily’s head, i did feel like Kath was written a little shallowly. I enjoyed getting a glimpse of San Francisco in the 1950s. I enjoyed the idea of exploration of lesbian bars and nightlife, but the execution fell a little flat imo, though I think I would have liked some of that more in a book with adult main characters and a more adult focus). A good read! If you are going to read it, be prepared for period-typical homophobia and racism.  4,5 Wow cóż to była za książka! Miałam, co do niej naprawdę duże oczekiwania i nie zawiodłam się!! Wspaniała historia, nie tylko o przyjaźni czy miłości, ale przede wszystkim o poznawaniu siebie! Nie często zdarza mi się myśleć o książce niemalże w każdej wolnej chwili. Tej historii zgodnie z moim oczekiwaniami udało się to osiągnąć!! Jedyne, do czego mogę mieć jakieś zastrzeżenia, to zakończenie. Pomijając już fakt, że nie przepadam za takim typem zakończeniem, mam wrażenie, że było bardzo szybkie? Czuję przez to lekki niedosyt. Przez to też cały czas łapie się na myśleniu, że nie skończyłam jeszcze tej książki. Niektóre sceny były też trochę bez sensu, nie wnosiły kompletnie nic do fabuły. Jednak te dwie kwestie nie są czymś, co wpłynęłoby drastycznie na ocenę tej historii. Wiem, że to na pewno nie ostatnie moje spotkanie z książkami tej autorki!!  5/5 ⭐yo sé que el libro termina con una nota esperanzadora y la autora nos cuenta que both la kath y la lily cumplieron sus metas y trabajan en lo que les gusta, y también sé que han pasado 70 años y algo ha avanzado la humanidad, pero tengo mucha pena???siento que el libro cuenta una historia muy personal a la autora y no tiene nada que ver conmigo de muchas formas, pero me vi muy reflejada hacia el final del libro??? ni cagando es la misma situación, pero no sé me dio mucha pena. pq además a diferencia de la lily yo sí miento constantemente??? pq sí es más fácil y sí incomoda menos y me genera menos problemas. no sé si tiene mucho sentido pq yo no tengo una pareja q lo haga tan evidente pero siento esa necesidad de esconder esa segunda yo de la que habla en el libro???? ughhhhfilo, quién te dio derecho a andar hablando de mí sin mi permiso malinda lo!!! nos vemos en tribunales oh my god ; i almost gave it two stars but that ending was absolutely ridiculous i couldn’t — you mean to tell me the pace of the book was snail from start to finish ? with plot you can’t convince me of ? — first what was the story i think we tried to add so much but delivered on nothing ; second when did they like each other i did not believe that for a second ; historical fiction that just sets you up for what you know happened in that time AND STILL doesn’t set the scene of it — we knew everything that was to happen you don’t have to read this book to know ; i also just could not feel bad watch holding the man watch carol idk what my policeman omg even that was better queer storytelling — anyways felt like a waste of time she should’ve stayed running away you don’t even get the satisfaction of the reunion bc what growth did she have in that time ?? #candyshopreads ☠️   Last Night at the Telegraph Club is a beautifully written coming of age story about Lily, a young gay Chinese American woman living in San Francisco in the 1950s. While still in high school, Lily becomes attracted to a fellow classmate and slowly begins to realize her identity against a wider backdrop of McCarthyist suspicion. Her changing priorities shift her relationships with family and friends alike.I've admired Lo's fantasy work in the past but this is the first of her contemporary novels I've read. Her characterization and pacing are so well done. It's easy to see why this book won so many awards, and Lo deserves every single one of the literary flowers she's been awarded for this work. Many books purport to convey the experience of teenage love, but few books make you feel so intensely. Highly recommend.  This story is vibrant with humanity and vulnerability; it moved from me from the first to the last page. It's a historical fiction following an American-Chinese girl coming to terms with her sexuality in the 1950s, during the Red Scare. The historical aspect is really essential to the story and the author, not only does it deal with a whole moment of history often neglected, but it also bring depth to the characters and make each of their struggle more intense. Seeing Lily discovering and embracing who she is is soft and inspiring and her relationships with Kath and the other women from the Telegraph Club are really well-written. I just loved it, like really. It's the perfect own-voices YA queer historical fiction.   i've never read about a diaspora experience that takes place in the 50s, let alone one that revolves around a queer character, so it was really interesting to see how the time period influenced both of lily's identities. there was a passage about how she felt like she'd been split in two, where one half of her was the respectable chinese daughter that her parents expected her to be and the other was queer and wrong and would never be welcome, and it basically summed up my entire life. although modern society is much more accepting of both the chinese and queer community, i wonder how much would really change if the story took place today - the intersection of both identities is still a tricky one to navigate. but yeah! i really enjoyed this story! i don't normally care for historical fiction but this made me want to read more!!(also eddie was a super minor character but his unwavering support was so sweet i had to give him a shoutout 🥺)  Stop what you’re doing now…yes you.. and go read this book.Malinda Lo has written such a deeply atmospheric and accurate book about the city of San Francisco. Within that there’s also deep historical context for both Chinatown and the unnerving political landscape at the time. She also moved my heart with the story if Lily and Kath two high school seniors at Galileo High who are smart with big dreams and discovering themselves. As they begin to go to The Telegraph Club a Lesbian bar off of Broadway Street, I love the thrill of their shared secret, the uneasy communication pleading to ask are we alike and of course the cast of characters who help them model lives full of possibilities. UGH. I love it so much.  When 17-year-old Lily Hu finds a book about a relationship between two girls, she begins to question everything about who she is. Lily lives in San Francisco’s Chinatown, in 1954, so the Red Scare still threatens everyone in her community. Chinese Americans are losing their papers, jobs, and friends due to paranoia about Communism. At school, Lily finds herself drawn to Kathleen Miller, a girl who her friends tell her to stay away from. As Lily gets to know Kath better, she is excited to join her at the Telegraph Club, a lesbian bar Kath has been to before. As their relationship begins to deepen, and Lily discovers more about who she is, she must decide whether or not it’s worth it to risk everything for love. Lily and her family could lose everything if her relationship with Kath is discovered.I loved this storyline, but it started out a bit too slow for me. I’m really glad I stuck with it, for I flew through the last 200 pages in 24 hours. A unique and beautiful story about the power of love, and need for it, especially during tough times.  eu definitivamente não tenho coração para escrever essa resenha.queria poder vir aqui e falar o quanto esse livro significou para mim; contar como eu ri, me apaixonei, gritei, chorei e me emocionei com essa história e essas personagens; e mostrar as milhares de marcações que fiz em cada página; mas nada do que eu escrever aqui vai traduzir nem mesmo 1% do quão importante esse livro foi para mim. eu queria poder voltar no tempo e dar esse livro de presente pra camila de 15 anos, mas ao mesmo tempo foi incrível poder ler essa história pela primeira vez nesse exato momento. cada palavra, cada cena, cada personagem traz um mundo inteiro dentro de si e é um mundo que, mesmo existindo em 1954, tem um pouquinho de mim. e não poderia deixar de agradecer à julia por me dar esse livro (que se tornou um dos meus favoritos) de presente e por fazer parte da minha vida! &lt;3 obrigada!  What a great story. I loved the characters and how the plot unfolded, even though some parts of the book felt a little slow. The story kept me hooked all of the way through, and there were definitely moments where I audibly gasped at what I had read. I have not read a book with such a relatable protagonist in a long time. I related to Lily’s navigation of her sexuality and the expectations that her parents set for her. It warmed my heart to know that someone else (even if they were fictional) experienced something similar to what I did. There are so many wonderful themes in this story, and so much to learn. This book was full of diversity and culture, and it was so fun and interesting to read. Everyone should read this book, I would definitely recommend it!  3.7ishread in 3 daysfollows lily, a 17 year old chinese american girl living in san francisco’s chinatown during the 1950s, and her experience navigating her sexuality at the lesbian bar Telegraph Club with Kath Milleri love a good character driven story me but a little too slow for my liking especially in the middle-ish. lots of setting the scene and build up, but for a worthwhile endingi know they’re in love but their connection didn’t fully come across to me (other than the typical innocence and uncertainty of first love in general) i know the point of the book is more coming of age than anything else but could the relationship have been explored moreit’s very possible i just don’t fully understand the 1950s red scare scene but i was confused by some of the depiction of the us/china/east asia relations Lo included. not that you have to be an expert in US history to read this though the authors note at the end is very informative &amp; interestingedited bc i just learned that it's YA so i did bump it up. makes sense bc the characters aren't as deep as i would have liked  I LOVED this book.It's not easy for me to love a YA romance book (they're just really not my taste) but this book is a huge exception. This book is so beautiful, so tender, and infused with the atmospheric backdrop of nightlife from 1950's San Francisco. I really loved the overall mood of the book, how soft and intimate some scenes could feel while others were like bursts of color saturated into dense waves of fog. I found the pacing to be just right. I loved Lily, the MC, and her aspirations to work in astrophysics, her story arch in self-discovery and her evolving love towards Kath. I loved the characters she meets along the way and I had more hope that her family would be accepting, but this is 1950's America of course and the book stays true to reality. The book explores themes of sexuality intolerance and microaggressions. A perfectly relatable read for today. .  buat yang suka 'The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo', gue rasa, kalian juga pasti bakal suka buku ini. selain karena mengambil tema yang hampir mirip, vibes tahun 1950-an nya dan juga perasaan 'frustasi' yang timbul ketika membaca kisah tentang sesuatu yang masih dianggap tabu dan sebuah aib pada masa itu, membuat gue menjadikan buku ini favorit gue juga.selain karena hal-hal yang gue sebutin di atas, gaya penulisan buku ini juga ringan banget dan gampang banget dimengerti. gak rumit dengan majas-majas atau kalimat-kalimat yang njelimet. tapi bukan berarti gaya penulisan yang simple itu bikin buku ini jadi biasa aja. enggak sama sekali.kisah yang diceritain di buku ini justru bikin buku ini jadi wah banget buat gue. karena bukan cuma masalah 'hal' yang tadi gue bilang tabu, tapi juga ada unsur-unsur politik dan rasisme diangkat di buku ini.menarik.  3.5⭐️The pacing of this felt very off to me. It started sooo slow and there were random chapters set back in time from the protagonist’s parents POV that I could’ve done without. I think one of my other complaints is that the main character felt very flat and like she had no personality and that led me to not really care too much about her relationship with Kath, even though that’s the meat of the story. However there’s something so heartbreakingly heartfelt about reading queer love stories set during this time period, and even more so reading from an Asian American’s perspective during the red scare. From a historical standpoint, this book was amazing and covered so many topics so very thoroughly.  More of a 3.5???This is one of the most interesting and unique historical fiction books I've ever read. I really liked how Malinda Lo wrote about the racism Lily experienced, but also about the homophobia she faced from her own family and friends. It was beautiful to watch Lily figure out who she was and come to terms with being a part of the queer community during this time. The sad thing was that the first half of this book fell flat for me. I had a really hard time continuing to listen to it as I constantly caught my mind wandering. The last 30-40% of the book is where things really started to pick up. I wish the ending would have been a larger majority of the book instead of confined to the epilogue.   I loved this book. Lily was a really relatable and realistic character. In the beginning of the book she was quite dependent and couldn‘t imagine a life without her life long friend Shirley. She did what other people expected her to do and she never rebelled or tried to break free. But through the course of the book Lily get‘s more and more independent. She realises that she is repressing herself in order to fit in. Which I think can be really relatable for a lot of people. When she finally comes to terms with her sexuality she accepts it (as she should bc slay). I really love Lily‘s development because she went from the girl who did what others told her to do to someone who knows what she wants and has the courage to stand by it. Because in the end her parents and Shirley practically begged her to just say that she wasn’t going to the Telegraph Club or to say that Kath had manipulated/seduced her. But she refused to do that and she told the truth. I love and admire her for that.  i really really loved this book, it did an amazing job showing us lily's life, her hopes, dreams and fears. we can see the amount of research that went into making it as historically accurate as possible while being a work of fiction. even though the main character is in high school, it is not written like a YA book and if i absolutely adored the aspect of the book about lily discovering her sexuality, i also really enjoyed the political and civil rights aspects of it. the writing is very poetic and beautiful, there are several scenes that i felt the need to re-read multiple times to make sure i enjoyed them as much as i could. the YEARNING of lily and kath, really is something.  Age: High SchoolHistory: 1950s San Francisco Identity: 2nd gen Chinese AmericanLGBTQ: coming-of-age lesbian romanceSTEM: Space explorationAnother tremendous addition to historical fiction novels that are intriguing and page-turning. Lo writes a heart-melting romance between Lily and Kath but doesn't stop there. All aspects of Lily's identity are explored, examined, and influence each other: her career aspirations, her family, her culture, her neighborhood, and her emerging curiosity into a world outside her own. This is a fascinating presentation of intersectionality and it is highly recommended for fans of unexplored/suppressed history and queer fiction.  This book is so well done. It’s definitely a slow burn - by page 150 we’ve covered most of the synopsis - but somehow that doesn’t detract from the overall story. The writing is beautiful, and the coming of age elements are fantastic. We really are figuring everything out at the same pace that Lily, the MC, is. I didn’t really care for the short flashback sections. I didn’t find they added much to the overall storyline, and I could’ve done without them. I guess they were meant to bring humanity to some of the side characters, but I didn’t feel like the sections revealed that much to make them worthwhile. I also felt like there were a LOT of side characters, and they all pretty much had short, one to two syllable names that I kept mixing up. The author’s note at the end of the book is super long but very interesting, and talks about real historical aspects and has more recommended reading. Definitely recommend!  4.5⭐️What a wonderful historical fiction romance.Not only we get to see the world of San Francisco’s Chinatown in the 50’s, the threat of deportation of American-Chinese due the USA’s hate and fear of communism, and also the lively but underground nightlife of the gay clubs.I loved our main character, Lily, she’s curious, sweet, intelligent, honest and so determined, the way the author showed us her finding out about her sexuality and desires was done beautifully. It’s the first book I’ve read with a lesbian romance and I was so hooked, i absolutely loved everything about it, and the tale it told. All the background and historical elements made it feel more real alive, it also explained how the characters were brought up and differently faced the challenges of being gay.Lily’s family is awesome and even though things don’t always work out, I loved the flashbacks into their lives, and the way things progressed in the story.It was a great read and I was just sorry to see it end so quickly.   A truly amazing read!! So beautifully written, without relying on flowery descriptions (which I also love). Each sentence seems very simple but just beneath the surface, there is a whole host of other meanings. The feeling of being a lesbian has remained largely unchanged during modern history, and will likely remain unchanged for many decades to come. This book captures it perfectly and touched me on a deep level.The author clearly did a HUGE amount of research in order to portray Lily's story just right. I understand there's very little material to find about lesbian Chinese Americans in the 1950s compared to other groups. It takes a very talented author to submerge a reader completely back in time as Malindo Lo did.    4.5 stars!! such a cute book!! I really felt like I was in the 50s in San Francisco, the descriptions were that good. This was my first historical fiction book I think and I really enjoyed it! The romance was so great and wholesome, some parts hit very close to home. The last part of the book and every scene in the Telegraph club were a 10/10, but in between the pacing was a little too slow for me, especially at the beginning. I’d totally recommend this if you wanna learn something about the queer and Chinese culture in the 50s in America and if you’re just looking for a sweet sapphic love story!   To all the Asian American girls questioning their sexuality, this book is a depiction of someone who stepped in those puddles before you saw them.I don’t often come across a lesbian romance in which I feel so connected to. In fact, I almost never read lesbian romances because that was never my line of interest for fiction. However, as a pretty straight dude, I felt like I somehow saw the character as a close friend who I never got to know. I rate it 4/5 because the storyline was very predictable. But it was very much worth the read and I would recommend it to anyone who likes to explore or learn about identity, even if not about their own.  I loved this book so much. Oh my gosh. It was so good. You think that because this book is about a lesbian couple in the 1950's I would assume right off the bat that it was going to be sad, however, I did not. All of the characters just seemed so real and developed. Unlike most teen novels, I felt all of their actions were needed and understandable. I almost started crying near the end because of the timeline. I loved how this book tells the story of both the mom and the daughter, it just adds so much. And though I didn't really know about most of the events that were said on the timeline, I really liked it. I think this book would've been so much better if I had knowledge of the Chinese American culture and history during the red scare, but other than that this book was amazing.   Five stars on a gay scale for a lot of cute lesbians, drag, gender expression Not a fan of coming-of-age stories, from the first pages though I was investedDidn't feel like reading, I was there, an invisible participator in the story The description of the first encounter with queer culture was so familiar, the initial excitement, the naive adoration, the fear and thrill of needing to protect it and keep it safe for yourself. THE IMMEDIATE UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR FELLOW GAYS when Everyone says you're a mistake. A little clishe, but an adorably discussed oneBy the second half it did start to become a bit repetitive and I wished to skip descriptions Wonderful experience nonetheless  I don't think that I've ever given 5 stars to a YA romance, but this was...so much more than that!! I think that as a book, it's probably closer to 4-4.5 stars than 5, but bumping up because I'm so excited that a book like this even exists. A queer Asian-American coming of age story in San Francisco during the Red Scare?? Also so well researched like dang I actually learned a lot too. The actual story was so sweet, and I loved that really only 30% of the book was about the romance - it felt more real that every character had a million other things going on in their lives. I loved this - was recommending it to all my friends by the time I was halfway through.   3.5 ⭐️Dou esta pontuação relativamente baixa ao livro devido não à história em si, mas sim devido à forma como o enredo se desenvolveu, ou seja, a articulação entre as diversas ações que foram ocorrendo. Este livro tem uma premissa muito boa, com personagens igualmente boas. Contudo, não me senti entusiasmada na sua leitura, não como acontece com outros livros em que devoro a sua leitura em poucos dias. Demorei praticamente uma semana a ler este livro. No geral, gostei de ficar a saber mais sobre a população sino-americana e em especial as mulheres sino-americanas queer. Sinto que me ajudou aprofundar o meu conhecimento e por causa disto fico com pena de não conseguir dar uma pontuação mais elevada a este livro.  I'm just gonna say I'm SO GLAD AND SO RELIEVED this had more of a "The Handmaiden" ending than a "Your Name Engraved Herein" one cuz it came so dangerously close and I was losing it 😭This was such a heartwrenching story with such a tough and dangerous journey for the protagonists. The story gives insight into what it's like to be a lesbian in 1950s San Francisco with the backdrop of Chinese American Immigration and tensions with American Immigration laws. It follows the developmental identity confusions that come with grappling with one's sexual orientation and what those realizations could mean not only for oneself but for those around them. I have so much love for Lily and Kath and I want to give them a big warm hug 🫂 I can only hope they have the happy ending they absolutely deserve  Zbierałam się trochę, żeby napisać ocenę, bo nie ukrywając nie chce mi się 👍👍 Ogólnie pomysł fabuły mi się spodobał już na samym początku, ale trochę czasu mi zajęło, by wkręcić się w akcję, nie jest tam zbyt dużo dialogów, co nie ułatwiało sytuacji, ale ostatecznie mi się udało, co sprawiło, że teraz w głowie mam wspomnienia, które przypominają urywki serialu/filmu. Interesuje mnie temat, jaki porusza ta książka i problem, jaki wskazuje. Mimo, że czas akcji dzieje się kilka dekad temu, to ludzie cały czas stykają się z sytuacjami, w jakiej znalazła się główna bohaterka i mogą się z nią utożsamiać. Postacie były dosyć oryginalne, zwłaszcza jedna z pobocznych bohaterek (shirley, której nie lubię). W ogólnym zarysie książka była ciekawa, była o czymś, co mnie interesowało i daje do myślenia, ale jednak odkładając ją na półkę w trakcie czytania, nie miałam chęci do niej powrócić, praktycznie musiałam się zmuszać, bo wiedziałam, że nie jest WCIĄGAJĄCA, a jedynie ciekawa. Dlatego dałam 3 gwiazdki 💋  A fresh, tender, queer Asian-American coming of age story set in 1950's SF Chinatown. The experience of making choices that go against the grain of all that is expected of you — by family, community, hegemonic society — is a universal one that we all go through to ~come of age~, but I related to so many aspects of Lily's experience that I was especially weepy at the end. Fun fact, Malinda Lo is my first cousin once removed, and it was healing to see elements of our family history woven into the political backdrop of the 1950s through a Chinese American and queer lens. Highly recommend also for people who live in/grew up in the Bay — a lil taste of SF history that's fun to compare to our contemporary experience of the city! Overall a very cute, quick, enjoyable read  50s lesbian chinese-american san francisco with communists. reminded me of sarah waters and it had a solid storytelling style and was almost cosy even tho it was dealing with some stuff. felt it might have been a little long and maybe it could have been paced a little better? but ultimately, an enjoyable historical novel that made me feel that i was back in san francisco. also loved the authors notes that talked about being queer in the 50s and the chinese-american experience at that time.   3.75 stars. I really enjoyed this book. I loved the setting in San Fransico in the 50s, I loved the representation of Chinese American and LGBTQ characters and the aspects of war and politics. It was really interesting. We mainly read from the POV of Lily, a young Chinese American girl who gets introduced to the secret world of the Telegraph Club. She makes new friends and starts questioning her believe and own identity and sexuality. It's a very nice coming of age story. I also liked the changes in POV and the timeline throughout the book, it really contributed to the story.All in all it was a nice read but it didn't really stick with me.   i’m struggling a bit w how to rate this one but i think 3.5 stars?? will update in the morningedit 5/23/2021: it's a 3.5 star read for me! i really enjoyed a lot of aspects of LAST NIGHT AT THE TELEGRAPH CLUB, and in many ways it's one of the best queer coming-of-age stories i've read so far — at the very least, it's definitely the one i've resonated the most with personally (which is kind of tragic because this is literally about a chinese lesbian in 1950s san francisco.... and i'm writing this review in 2021. like how do i have more in common with this girl from the '50s than i do with any of the queer protagonists i've read about who supposedly live in the same century as me???). this is a strong YA read in that most of my issues with it weren't those that i typically have with YA books. it managed to avoid shallow character development and shitty dialogue and insta-love, and i actually really loved our protagonist, lily — she was such a complex and well-written character, and i really appreciated all the nuance that malinda lo granted her. LAST NIGHT AT THE TELEGRAPH CLUB is also unique and wonderful in that it explores an aspect of queer culture that's criminally neglected in literature, but especially in YA: the bar scene!! gay bars are an integral part of queer history; they were more than a fun place to be and drink, but were community organizing spaces and, in many cases, the only places in which queer people could freely be themselves and be with those they loved. i loved that LAST NIGHT AT THE TELEGRAPH CLUB used a queer bar as a setting in such an authentic manner, with it acting as a backdrop to lily's gay awakening in the exact way that such spaces were to thousands of queer youth decades ago. i also really enjoyed how malinda lo explored the unique challenges lily faced as a lesbian of color, but specifically as an asian lesbian. the microaggressions and flat-out racist comments weren't included for the sake of shock value, but simply to reflect the reality that many queer asian women faced and continue to face. unfortunately, the invisibility of queer asian women persists in the present — personally, i've experienced microaggressions ranging from being called a unicorn because "asian lesbians don't exist" (someone literally said this to my face in a gay bar in nyc a few years ago lmfao) to being told by other queer women that they've "never been with an asian before." mind you, i'm not talking about my experiences with straight people — i'm talking about members of my own community, including, at times, fellow poc. i hate being told that i can't possibly exist and that people like me are so rare, when in actuality, we just haven't been included in many narratives, or have been erased from them. i really appreciated lo's effort to shed light on these real histories through lily and her story. i wish these strengths were enough for me to give LAST NIGHT AT THE TELEGRAPH CLUB a 4-star rating, but unfortunately, i had several issues with the book, which i will now bullet point below:- kath and lily's love story definitely wasn't insta-love, and i think how their relationship began is pretty true to reality in that closeted queer people sometimes don't need much common ground beyond their queerness in order to become close, or even romantically interested in each other. (emphasis on the "closeted.") but with that being said, i wish kath's character had been as fleshed out as lily's and that we were able to learn more about her as a person. we know that she loves flying and wants to be a pilot and that she's a baby butch, but beyond that, we don't get much of a grasp on her personality. we don't know who her other friends are, we don't know why she likes lily, and frankly, we don't really know why lily likes her beyond the fact that they're both baby gays. which, again, isn't necessarily unrealistic, but if we're supposed to believe that these two are in love love, i need more from them!- i didn't understand why shirley and lily's friendship was such a large focal point of the novel if it ended up not mattering much to the story? after the last time we see shirley, we don't know what happens to her and lily's friendship, whether they come to a resolution, never speak again, hate each other's guts, etc. i do understand that shirley and lily's friendship is meant to be juxtaposed against lily's burgeoning relationship with kath (the person she's always been/pretended to be vs. the person she's becoming and actually wants to be), but i didn't like how their conflict was essentially abandoned and rendered insignificant to the story. - i also didn't like the ending in general. i'm not going to spoil anything, but it was so unsatisfying for me personally — i understand that it was probably the most realistic outcome of any of lo's other options considering that it was the '50s, but in many ways, it felt like a cop-out. - in general, lo spent too much time on smaller plotlines that ended up being entirely insignificant. some of these plotlines were meant to communicate the political tensions of the times/what life was generally like for chinese americans in the '50s, with the red scare and threats of deportation and issues with immigration, but she spent enough time on them that i thought they would end up being significant to the plot... and they weren't. lo probably could've cut this book down to 350-or-so pages, and i think that would've reduced a lot of the filler space.  The sweetest of this book melted my heart. Lily and Kathleen are such cute and wonderful young women. They are finishing high school and dreaming of careers in a world where those careers felt maybe possible but mostly a dream. Not only is Lily different because she loves sci-fi and wants to work in the space program but she is also discovering that she's attracted to women. Lily is Chinese-American and the reality of what that means in Cold War San Francisco are very clear. I loves the felling of time and place in this book. Every historian I know that has read this book has enjoyed it.  5/5 -  one of the best young adult books I've read Young adult with a side of historical fiction and seasoned with racial and cultural issues, Last Night at the Telegraph Club is a page-turner about discovering love for the first time, grappling with being Asian in a predominantly white country and a characterization of how repressive the 1950s truly was. At one point, the book made me so angry I wanted to stop reading. That's a pretty clear sign about how invested I became in Lily. But in any case, here is a young adult book that reads like a young adult book without condescension. Highly recommend.   I've waited to long to write a review for this one. I remember being mesmerized when I finished it and having so much to share. Nevertheless, the fact that it's landed so many awards and/or nominees should help it speak for itself. It was a National Book Award for Young People's Literature, a Michael L. Printz Award Nominee, a Goodreads Choice Award Nominee for Young Adult Fiction, a Walter Dean Myers Award, and it made my #MustReadin2022 list. I'll be looking forward to seeing more from Malinda Lo!  (3.5 stars)i’ve never been more happy that a book had an epilogue.this story follows Lily Hu, a 17 year old Chinese-American girl living through the Red Scare of the 1950s, as she comes to terms with her sexuality and the risks that come along with it. with her father at risk of deportation, Lily and Kathleen Miller risk it all to be in each other’s lives. this was such an interesting story, i absolutely loved learning about Lily’s family and their history! i was also so excited by the footnotes that Malinda Lo included so that her readers could understand the Chinese cultural and linguistic references throughout the book. i also loved the romance (once it finally happened!) the reason i haven’t rated this higher was because the book just felt SO long and it dragged a lot through the middle. the last quarter was SO SO GOOD, i just thought it could have been like 100 pages shorter.   This was an extremely beautifully written historical queer novel that evaded many tropes that often bother me in stories about queer people in the past. I could picture the setting very well and I learned a lot and had fun while reading. With all of these aspects it could have easily become one of my favourite books, but somehow it didn't have a big emotional impact on me. I can't exactly say why, maybe I just didn't feel the chemistry between the main couple that much... Still it's an extremely well done book and I'd recommend it to everyone who's interested in (especially queer) historical fiction.  Omgomg i loved this book so much. The setting of sf chinatown is so close to my heart and the cultural ties too. Even down to how Lily’s family came to America, I recognized her experience. The beginning was a bit repetitive as it was just like a hundred pages of gay awakening, but as the world of the club gets more revealed the book was so hard to put down. I loved the historical fiction, too, and it was really well researched and done! It truly was so wonderful to read a book where it shows a slice of asian queer life, even if much of the history is speculation. Also i’m obsesseddd with Kath,,, anyways i loved this book ok goodbye.  Finding young adult books that I actually want to read has become a little more challenging as I get older since most ya isn’t written with me in mind. Yet, I did enjoy this one. We get a glimpse of what life was like in the U.S for Chinese immigrants and their children, particularly on the west coast in a more… silently accepting city for those that quietly knew they were part of the outside but knew it wasn’t safe to come out. Seeing a girl of color interested in rockets and develop a cute romance has a lot of ups and downs but I’m keen to read more by this author.   I’m in literal shambles. This book is so much more than a wlw romance. There is a quote on the front cover that puts my thoughts into words: “this book is for anyone who has ever loved- in any sense of the word.” Just stunning really.I imagine the song Glimpse of Us by Joji being the song for this novel if that means anything to y’all…Quote that sent me: “how precious she was, and how miraculous.”(Like r u FRRRR this is the new standard on how I am to be addressed 😭❤️ it’s giving “you sunshine you temptress” but by a factor of 1,000,000) anyway go read this book omg i’ll die for it)  Piękna historia. Bardzo mi przybliżyła sytuację chińskich imigrantów w latach 50 w USA. Pouczająca książka i obarczona tak wielkim smutkiem, nie jest on wymuszony, a końcówka jest słodko gorzka, to próba pocieszenia czytelnika, który domyśla się jaki jest koniec dalszy tej historii. Wspaniałe jest to jak bardzo historycznie poprawna jest ta książka i jak wiele autorka pod koniec w posłowiu opisuje swoje źródła i inspiracje. Poznajcie historię Lily i Kath i też pozwólcie złamać sobie serce... 💓  a historical fiction about a chinese american girl finding her place in the 1950s san francisco and the queer community.i fell in love with this story. i literally have no words left. this just became one of my all time favorites. it was an emotional rollercoaster. i fell in love with lily, with kath, with lana, with tommy and with the whole telegraph club.historical fiction is not always my piece of cake but i‘m so glad i gave this one a chance. these kind of stories about the history of the queer and lesbian community and especially the minorities within that group are rare but so special. seeing queer happiness in history makes my heart ache with joy and pride. it also makes me realize all over again how others have come before us. they have struggled and they have fought so that we could love.  I liked this book quite a lot. It is a slow and small burn, but it burns very bright. Reading about Chinese-Americans living in the 1950's was enlightening, especially paired with the queer community at that time. I found myself cringing at the blatant micro-aggressions towards Chinese-Americans, wishing they weren't included originally, but then coming to a place of understanding as to why they were included. The characters Lily and Kath were easy to picture and love. It erred on the side of romance and mystery. I wish the book had more of a complete ending (I love the "falling action" phase of books) but I assume Lo kept it more open-ended to give the reader a chance to fill in the blanks as they see fit. Overall it was entertaining and educative.   4.5 stars I loved this book so so much. It was very informative for one and taught me some stuff but it also was just very very good. I loved following lily’s story and her journey of self discovery. The book was both heartwarming but sad at the same time and it left me wanting more but being satisfied at the same time. I will re-read this and it’s definitely on the list so far for my favorite reads of this year. It was a little slow at some parts which is why I went with 4.5 but I also didn’t hate the slow parts either. Other than that though this book is a must read honestly.   3.5 / 5this was a beautiful story of how sapphic love could develop and survive in the harsh environment of the 1950s in America. the main characters are faced with a lot of challenges; such as homophobia, racism, the threat of deportation, and a community that relies heavily on the secrecy of their lifestyle. it was wonderful to see other sides to how it was back then, and made a wonderful read. however, i only cared so &amp; so about the main characters and found myself skimming a lot of the times when paragraphs of food, other women the mc was admiring, the damn pageant, etc, ran for too long. in conclusion, it was a good read, but nothing more memorable or special about it.  [5 stars] A historical YA coming-of-age romance about a young Chinese woman in 1950's San Francisco discovering her sexuality and first love. This was a very sweet and endearing book. I'd previously read some of Malinda Lo's speculative fiction, and have to admit that I liked this realistic novel more. Lily was likable without being too saccharine, and I enjoyed the science-curious aspect of her character. I liked how the nonlinear timeline wove in flashbacks to other family members, and wish that there had been more of this, especially for Grace (Lily's mother) and Judy (Lily's paternal aunt). I thought that the Red Scare plot arc provided an added layer of cultural complexity, and respect how key characters were written as non-snitchers but also wish Lily’s family had more resolution of the subplot. The author's note at the end was fascinating, and offered lots of queer and Asian history. Recommended for readers who enjoy a good balance of drama and romance, those looking to dip a toe into YA and want some substantive, or anyone who can appreciate a love letter to northeastern San Francisco.Goodreads Challenge 2023: 20/52Dates Read: 5/21/23-5/29/23  I already know this is going to be one of my favorite books of the year.Malinda Lo did an excellent job of introducing me to an area of history I had little familiarity with--the lesbian scene of 1950s San Francisco, as well as Chinese-American culture in San Francisco's Chinatown (and how the two might overlap). I particularly enjoyed the detailed historical notes at the end of the book that show the sheer amount of research Lo has done.I found Lily to be a very realistic and relatable teen protagonist. And the novel is thoughtful and nuanced in the way it depicts her exploring her sexuality while trying to adhere to her family and cultural expectations.  I was just made seventeen again and felt all the pain that came with it. I’m half teenager as I sit here typing this out. I’m speechless. So simple, intricate, wise, that so many sensations and feelings Lily has map directly onto memory, word for word. Triumphant and actual. This is the truest-to-life, closest-to-home book I’ve read in a while, and I know a little more vividly having read it what I have seen and what I have felt, and how those things are at once shared by many women and characters and also can never, despite the parallels, be recreated.  This book is definitely making my list of top reads of the year! I adored it and talked in detail about it in a video review. Basically, this is an extremely well-researched, immersive historical fiction that does an amazing job of exploring a coming of age story for a queer, Chinese-American teenage girl in the 1950s, which isn't a setting and perspective you often get! I loved how it tackled political, identity, and family dynamic issues, all while being a very quiet book about growing up and learning yourself. I definitely recommend this book and for sure will be reading more by Malinda Lo.Content Warnings:homophobia, toxic friendship, racist microaggressions, family disownment   this was so &lt;3333333333. the writing style was so beautiful and i loved the pacing of it all and how the plot was sad and hopeful just like how it is to be queer outside of fiction. so much of it made me feel emotional but also the fact that it took place in san francisco and there were whole chapters about ocean beach which was right next to my apartment as a child............yea.........yea........  I really appreciated the history and representation in this it was definitely a nice peek into gay bar culture and a glimpse into found family. Unfortunately, this just wasn’t for me. Call it a personal preference but the ending was abrupt and frankly more bitter than sweet. Although it is very realistic. I think I was just hoping for something happier and it wound up making me very upset/angry. 2.75/5  This is a beautiful, melancholic love story, and so much more than that. It's a piece of forgotten history, wrapped in a nicely flowing narration, and though it is fictional, it feels so real. It's obvious, even before you read about the author's research at the end, that she is very concerned with being authentic, to the language of the time period and to the erased experiences of the minorities at the time. There was something enchanting about this book. It was so - soft, and so sad, and so pretty, even in the mundane details of everyday life, in the sometimes understated language. I adore it with all my queer heart.  I don't know what I liked the most: learning about the 1950s' in San Francisco, the Asian-American history or the hidden lesbian society there was in the city. What I know for sure is that this book is a 10/10, really all the character's are chef's kiss (Kath, Shirley, Tommy... they are so unique) and Lily's coming of age development is amazing, how she discovers herself and becomes a strong girl who stands her position even though the easy way would be to give in...  4.5This book had me sobbing and shaking at 2 AM- I related to it a little too much. There were some parts that could’ve been done better, especially the ending, but I loved it overall. Also TW for slurs??? The D slur is in there but also the n slur? (spanish for black) which was SO unnecessary?? I get that this is historical fiction but Lo is an asian woman and definitely did not have to use that word.   This was a lovely book, but it was so hard to read in parts! That doesn't mean you shouldn't read it or that I regret reading it, though. It's hard to be queer now, and it was even harder in the 1950s--especially for a woman of color. Props to Malinda Lo for writing a book that was both heartbreaking and soul-nourishing. There was a lot of queer angst, but there was also a lot of queer joy. Truly marvelous.  This book is beautifully written and really explores a subsect of 1950’s history that I haven’t seen written about before. Historical fiction isn’t my usual genre so I’m not sure how many of the extra flashback chapters were necessary. They added some great context both into the adult figues in Lily’s life and the choices they make, as well as cultural attitude and practices of the time. But they did slow the pace down slightly and seemed to veer a little off-theme. On the whole I loved this book though, and thought Lily made a great protagonist as she grappled with the intersection of her identities and matured into herself over the course of the story.   Solid. Much better than the other YA I’ve read recently. I liked that the romance plotline didn’t have any superfluous love triangles or the “dating someone I don’t like but pining for my one true love the whole time” trope. I also thought the occasional chapters that focused on characters other than Lily, like the mother or the aunt, really added depth to the book. The mother in particular was a really interesting and complex character to me.   The whole vibe and background of the book made it really interesting for me (e.g. with the time lines).It gave room to so many clashes cultural, moral and believe wise.The descriptions and stories at the telegraph club made me wish I could be there and slurp a martini.☆side note: I skipped some of the flashback parts about her parents and aunt because they seemed kinda boring and off chart to me.  It isn't often that a YA book really reminds me what it felt like to be a teenager, but this one did! The historical details were fascinating too, and I loved reading the afterword explaining which parts were fictional and which parts were fact. It's definitely a slow build at the beginning, but I couldn't put the book down for the final eighth because I was so anxious to find out what would happen to Lily and Kath! I'm excited to see them again as adults in A Scatter of Light.   “she should feel guilty for being thrilled by it. the problem was, she didn’t. she felt as if she had finally cracked the last part of a code she had been puzzling over for so long that she couldn’t remember when she had first started deciphering it.”väga nagu midagi ei juhtunud, kõik plotpointid olid väga etteaimatavad 50ndate lgbt raamatu kohta. kõigil tegelastel oli nii palju potentsiaali, aga ükski tegelane ei olnud väga hästi üles ehitatud ja kõik oli lihtsalt nii basic. ei meeldinud väga tbh   4 1/2 stars. bruh. The ending gutted me like a fish I have no words. It was such a great book?? Lily was such a lovely main character and I loved that she was a Chinese American girl bc that’s important. Please give me more historical lesbian fiction I BEG. Only 4 1/2 and not 5 tho because I feel like we didn’t get to know Kath very much?? Bit of an underdeveloped love interest but we move bc the rest was so lovely   3,5/5.J'ai pas été transportée par l'histoire parce-que c'était un peu trop lent à mon goût. J'ai vraiment apprécié à partir de 5ème partie et ça fait très très tard.j'ai pas compris l'importance de certaines parties, on nous parle de quelque chose et le livre se fini comme si ça n'avait pas réellement d'importance...bon.J'ai bien aimé suivre Lily dans sa découverte de soi, mais c'était très long mais pas grand chose.(par contre l'audiobook est génial)  i usually hate historical fiction novels. this book is the ultimate exception to that. i felt so, so incredibly entranced in lily’s story throughout the entire book, i could not put this down. the depiction of intersectionality, the loneliness she feels no matter who she’s with, the struggle of grappling with herself. it spoke to me, a shit ton honestly. i could never fully relate to her, as i am neither a lesbian nor chinese, nor in the 1950s, but as a queer woman (?) of color, i can see so many bits of herself in me. this book spoke so deeply to me, i cried like a little baby at the end. highly, highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone. i genuinely feel it’s such an important book to read, especially for any queer people, or poc, and doubly so for queer poc. i adore it  i cannot express how much i love this novel and the way malinda lo writes such a engaging story set in San Fran in the 1950s was incredible. the romance itself was very cute and made my heartache and the love that lily and kath have and the risks they took and lilys own exploration to her own identity is something i definitely relate too and now knowing that this author wrote from her own experiences make it much more intimate   I looooooove a good coming of age book, especially with a queer focus. There were tender moments, tense moments, and best of all…so many sapphic moments. I appreciate how the author took into account the historical matters and influences of this particular period in world history. Even more so, Lily’s own struggle with her identity, being Chinese American, and even the generational conflicts with her own Chinese born parents. Really such a pull at the heart strings and following the ups and downs of a young girl navigating her own identity and desires. How to understand those different than us and how to cope with newness of a world you desperately wish to be part of. Would definitely recommend anyone who enjoys sapphic romance or historical fiction.   This book gave historical fiction vibes even though it wasn’t historical fiction! I really loved that aspect of this story! I also appreciated the teen angst without it being super cringy, like the teen angst typically comes across. The reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 was because the first quarter to almost half of the story was a set up for the main storyline, making it a little hard to stick with.   ‘In reality, Tommy was a woman made of flesh and blood, and that frightened Lily most of all’.This book is spectacular. At the beginning, I had no strong opinions, and then it just hits you all at once. I raced through the second half of the book, enduring tears as I went. The plot is brilliant, you fall completely in love with the protagonists and I just cannot recommend it enough.   I cried. I don't even know where to start. I freaking loved every second of this book because I saw myself in it. The story, the love, the family dynamic I understood it all. Also the fact that this is an LGBTQ POC author, I mean the representation is so flawless and executed so well how could someone not like this book? I really do agree with the qoute "this book is for anyone who has loved, in a sense", because it truly is.   A girl in 1950s SF Chinatown is gay. But how can that be? She’s a good Chinese girl. Fast forward 60 years and this was me walking the same SF streets, pulled by so many similar forces. This was not just any lesbian historical fiction for me. Reading this book was healing (how powerful it is to be told: you exist now. You existed in the past. You exist in the future.) besides the fact that it’s well executed. I loved that the ~villain~ (to the extent that this book even includes one) is the supposed best friend. Of course adolescence is filled with growing pains, including growing apart from old friends.   slow paced books make my heart so happy i expected to either really like or be really bored by this book because honestly? romance is very much a hit or miss for me. it’s not exactly my favorite genre. it used to be, but the clichés have taken over and i feel like it’s been ages since a romance book has actually made me feel giddy and hopeless and all that good shit only nicola yoon could seem to pull off. anyways, this book is incredibly realistic, which i loved— no random ass grand declarations of love, no “breaths she didn’t realize she was holding”, just pure, simple first love depicted in the way it should be. slow-paced books are always superior in my not so humble opinion, and the pace and language and multiple povs in combination with the culture? incredible. you can really tell that this book was written with a lot of love and care, and remained respectful of the restraints of the time while also giving a hopeful ending. phenomenal.5/5  Very enjoyable with a lot of history, representation, and intersectional identities that I had not explored until reading this novel. The only negative thing that I would say- which is a personal preference- is that the romance is a very slow burn. Beautiful writing, but the action did not pick up for me until the very end of the book.   It took me a while to warm up to this book as much as I thought I would, but when I did, I found it difficult to stop reading it.This was great; the themes of culture and sexuality were very interesting, and it was written very beautifully. I’d definitely recommend this! I’ll surely miss Lily and Kath and the feeling I got while reading the book for the first time.  sapphic historical fiction? sign me up. this book made me feel so many feelings, and i’m in awe over every part of it. the writing was beautiful, the characters were fleshed out, relatable, and realistic, the book made me feel like i was transported to the 1950s, and the love story made my heart ache. i feel like i need to hug this book and never let go  A carefully researched, beautifully nuanced picture of life in Chinese American culture in the 1950’s, emerging sexuality, and being between the cracks—between childhood and adulthood, between liking and love, between one culture and another, and how it feels to belong to none of these places. Highly recommended regardless of orientation.   I haven't felt such deep longing and tenderness while reading a novel for a long time. A beautifully written story of first love, discovering your queerness and community. Not always easy, as Lily has to deal with racism as well as queerphobia, but - hopeful and wonderful. 1950s San Francisco came to life, too.  This is what young adult books should be like. A meticulously researched story that highlights the love between two girls in San Francisco in the 1950s. Lily, the main character, is Chinese American living in Chinatown and she discovers that she is attracted to other girls. The story that follows is rich and layered and while it was very well researched, it also is just wonderfully written. I want to read the books listed in the footnotes now!  ✨4.5 stars✨Malinda Lo certainly struck a nerve. She may have written about Lily and Kath in 1950s San Francisco, but change the names and make the setting in current time 2022; and everything else will still be the same. Atleast here in my location, it will be. The Telegraph Club will be raided and Lily be sent to stay elsewhere (if not killed, in dark scenarios). 72 years later, we haven't progressed. We say we have but have we? Oh! Maybe we've visited the Moon and plan to make a colony on Mars. Some things have changed, I guess.  AAAH TEARS SO MUCH QUEER ANGTS I CANNOT really loved lily and kath &lt;3 i cannot imagine being gay in the 50s WTFF NO didnt give it 5 stars just because i didn't love the ending would have liked to see more :') but thats just mealso i did not expect much of sheirly to begin with but -- i hate her okay byee I loved the story, I really did but just had a hard time getting through some of the slower parts and felt it dragged a bit. I love reading about Lily’s journey on being gay and Chinese in the 1950s. The struggles she faced in her community and her own family did not stop her from being who she is or going after her dreams.   3.5 stars! oh this book was so heartbreaking for me to read. overall i really enjoyed it but some of it felt kinda underdeveloped ig? anyway i couldn’t decide whether to give this 3.5 or 4 stars bc it was really cute/sad but also kinda slow in a lot of parts and idk how to feel. i am sad now. overall a really great story tho  One of the best coming-of-age stories I have read, I think. Lo doesn't shy away from how difficult time period 1950 was for a lesbian Chinese-American girl finding her identity, but she also describes Lily's story with such understanding, tenderness and fierce hope. The way historical San Francisco comes alive in this story was also really great.  I have no words.. this was an emotional masterpiece which handled so many topics incredibly. you can tell that the author has done her research, communicating clearly to the reader about all those things. AND the fact that Tommy’s character is based on a REAL person and REAL events? I literally just did some further research and woah. i’m stunned. this deserves all the stars &lt;3  Lily and Kath are as different as night and day to me... but I loved their love story. I loved how unique this book was... plenty of Chinese words (and Chinese food!), flashbacks to Lily's parents, aunt, and uncle, and even timelines, so you could see what happened to Lily and when ... and what was happening in the real world at that time. I read the author's notes at the end, and I learned so much. My heart goes out to people who just want to love who they REALLY love.  While this book didn't go into much depth on any of the topics that were hit, I still thought the writing was beautiful and the story had value. I appreciate that I can read books that are about a time and place and culture that I may not know much about. And this book was that for me. The Author's Note at the back answered a lot of questions that I had while reading, but I wish that the detail could have been included throughout the story rather than in a note at the end.  Overall I really liked this book. The plot and the concept behind it was interesting and it wasn’t something I’ve read before. The beginning was really slow, and Lily was really awkward which threw me off at the start. About 1/3 of the way through it started picking up, and the last 150-200 pages were so good and really brought the story together. I also liked the way the epilogue brought the book to a close.   i really liked this books meaning and the little details. i can’t imagine how it would feel to be in the main character’s shoes but the author does a really good job of ptraying it. i really felt the emotion put behind this book and the storyline is so cute. it was a little slow but picked up and i really liked the epilogue and how it tied everything together  I’m struck by the warmth and belonging Lo threads through Lily’s life, even as she explores the repression and marginalization of being a Chinese-American queer girl in the 1950s. If you’re looking for a book about queer joy, this is certainly not it - the world’s a little too real. That said, there is something familiar and gentle in the safe spaces that Lily finds, the girls who meet her and know her, the self-discovery she navigates. There is hope and wonder in the queer adulthoods she bumps up against.  I really liked this historical fiction book about lesbian teens discovering their identities amid the racism and queerphobia of 1950s San Francisco. Not only was it a truly interesting story with great characters, but I also learned a lot about the history of Chinese immigration to California during WWII and the growth of SF's Chinatown. I liked that the story felt realistic in it's portrayal of family tension and discrimination without being a complete downer. Highly recommend for anyone who likes LGBTQ books and historical fiction.  4.5bardzo mi się podobała ta książka, klimat też miała taki pode mnie i bardzo bardzo polubiłam główna bohaterkę (to wcale nie tak że lubię każda bohaterkę lubiąca matematykę nie nie nie 🏃🏃🏃) i cieszę się że udało mi się zaangażować w tę książkę, bo ciężko jest mi się wkręcać w te bardziej obyczajowe, a ta była naprawdę świetna 💙  if i could i’d give this book a hundred more stars. absolutely loved and appreciated the way struggles of Chinese and gay people in those times were portrayed and except that there was still a great plot and moments that made me hold my breath several times. lily and kath r these types of characters that once you fall for them, you can never fall out of love. brb crying bye.   ★★★★☆ (4)cw: racism (inc. racial slurs &amp; outdated language), homophobia, lesbophobia, toxic friendshipthe way chinese-american culture is so lovingly woven into the narrative truly makes this book stand out. petition to start being inclusive of non-romanized dialogue in text with footnotes as a translation please!  so well written, honest, thoughtful, and subtle. relies so heavily on subtext and inference which is like catnip for me. i thought the ending was a little rushed and the chapters about lily’s family were out of place and interrupted the pace. also i didn’t find the love interest to be super compelling but i suppose it doesn’t matter so much   A coming of age story of a Chinese American Lily Hu who falls in love with another girl, Kathleen Miller. The 50s are not a happy time for anyone who's a non-conformist, the Cold War and Red Scare, homophobia and racism run rampant in US society. It's very well told and there's a bibliography in the back for further reading.I still don't understand why so many of my peers look back on the 50s as the best period for America, though ignorance and TV play a role in that. Also a good book for discussion.  I found myself very engaged with all of the times Lily went to the telegraph club or interacted with Kath in any way, but I was less interested in her drama with Shirley. I guess that's kind of to be expected as a queer woman reading this book; I'm more likely to identify with and be engaged in the queer focused parts. Overall it was a pretty good book, but I do think it could have been shorter.  Really good. I liked how Lo inserts little flashbacks in with brackets and that she included historical info at the end. I wasn't entirely sure what the point of the other characters' flashbacks were, but I liked them none the less. The ending seems very appropriate, tragedy, to hammer in the unfairness of it all, but also happy. Dealt with multiple social issues and did it well. Good quality book and enjoyable story.  It took me longer to finish but it was because I was busy and I actually annotated some stuff for the first time ! It started off a bit slow but it was good nevertheless.it was a good story which wasn’t too graphic to read and overall a cute love story to read .The ending character/pages were so sad but I am glad that they got to reconnect at the end . Like I said I felt like it was very realistic and an overall not complicated story to read well more in the beginning than the ending. I stayed up all night reading this book. It has such complexity and layers, and draws you in to the life of Lily's intersecting identities of being woman, lesbian, and Chinese. AND mathematically minded- and going to college for math in the 1950s. Her growing love for Kath made my heart ACHE. Oh, it's just such a good book.  ⭐️5/5 - nawet nie wiem od czego zacząć. Książka była piękna i wzruszająca. Poruszyła problem homofobii, która nadal niestety istnieje na tym świecie. W książce były długie opisy, które o dziwo mnie nie męczyły, podczas czytania ich i z przyjemnością przeczytałam każdy z tych opisów. Ta historia na pewno pozostanie w moim sercu na bardzo długi czas.   I don't know if I can adequately express how much I loved this book. It's so different from a lot of historical fiction set in the same period--full of light and life even when dealing with some harsh realities of its time. But it was ultimately the characters who won me over, and that so rarely happens. I loved this story, and I think any time someone in the future questions why we needed a gay rights movement (and why we still do), I'll point them here, to this book and these characters. A story like this might get across what I cannot.   I don’t think I can express in words how beautiful this story is. I related heavily to it as a lesbian and also learned so much as a white person who isn’t very educated in this particular era of history, especially for Chinese Americans. This story was so incredibly well researched and informational, and also so deep and moving with its characters and conflict. The pacing is perfect, the description is immersive, the characters are incredible, and the whole thing is just so amazing. This is worthy of every single award it has won. Absolutely phenomenal.  eh... czytajac te książkę czułam że śledzę wzrokiem tekst, a nie CZYTAM i dokończyłam ją tylko dlatego, że chciałam bardzo przeczytać coś stricte o tematyce lesbijek. Bardzo nudna i rozwlekła książka, a w niektórych momentach autorka jakby opisując coś zapominała właściwie, do czego dąży i pół strony opisu było totalnie bez sensu. Było pierdolnięcie na koniec, ale tak to trochę nic się nie działo, a w klimat weszłam dopiero koło 350 strony (z 500). Nie siadł mi totalnie styl pisania autorki.  A really important piece of YA historical fiction, the type of story we need more of. Although much of the plot was fairly predictable and meandering, it was still intriguing to see the experience of a lesbian Chinese teenager navigating both her sexual identity but also McCarthyism and just general 1950s racism. I feel like the 50s are often overlooked and I will admit I didn’t know as much as I thought about what was going on in China at the time and how that affected Chinese Americans.   This book was incredible and hit home to me so hard. I cannot tell you how much I saw myself in Lily’s slow journey in discovering her sexuality, and even her personality. This book was such a fun gateway into 1950’s San Francisco, especially Chinatown and the queer scene at the time. I also really enjoyed the characters of both Lily and Kath, and their struggles, dreams and ambitions.   3.5 stars! I really enjoyed this book but the reason I couldn’t give it a 4 or 5 is because I didn’t like the ending. I felt like there were still a lot of unanswered questions and it just wasn’t very satisfying. We never found out what happened with her aunt and uncle or if her parents ever accepted her (Lily). Besides the ending though, I did really enjoy this story.   dude this book. it was so complex but also so simple? i really appreciated the representation of the intersectionality between race, gender and sexuality. also it's a great queer love story imo-realistic in the sense that its not all or nothing. lily and kath's relationship is really just sweet and i want to be friends with them. i also liked that the author didn't try to put a band-aid over lily's issues with her parents/shirley at the end bc that would've made it feel so fake and idealistic. the depictions and juxtapositions of the different communities lily is part of were also so interesting and beautiful. i could actually talk about this book for hours. anyways the second half of this book made me feel literally every emotion and if i don't stop typing now i will keep rambling so everyone go read it now bye!  I adore this book. The slow moving, the establishment of the context, the characters. The coming out of Lily is an heartbreaking moment that made me cries my heart out. The description are powerful, the narrative made me a character of this beautiful story I loved it. Adorable, heartfelt, heartbreaking, and hopeful, this historical fiction explores the intersection between race and sexuality, all along the backdrop of the political contexts of the 1950s in San Francisco. me hizo acordar mucho a annie en mis pensamientos peroo este me gustó un poco más pq está todo mucho más desarrollado. no llega a 5 estrellas pero está ahí nomás. lo recomiendo mucho!! así q leanlo (sobre todo vos belén rata) "She wondered where Kath was. She wondered if Kath could sense her, sitting here on this train as it took her away. Perhaps it was possible, if she closed her eyes and sent out her thoughts along the steel track like a message along a telegraph wire. I love you. I love you. The train swayed gently beneath her, and she leaned against the window to feel the cool glass against her cheek, and she was sure that Kath had heard her, she was sure.""She’s having a hard time right now because you’re not what she expected. But we’re never what our parents expected. They have to learn that lesson."Lily + Kath 💘 I am so impressed by this book, especially that it’s geared towards young adults and sheds light on important moments in history. A coming-of-age story of a chinese-american girl living in San Francisco in the ‘50’s discovering her sexuality. This book not only covers her personal story, but also gives different multi-generational POV’s. I was so engrossed in the story and it was very difficult to put it down! Highly recommend. Also bonus points this gave me such Barbary Lane vibes😍  this book was beautiful. it focused on what it was like to be a lesbian, a chinese lesbian, in the 1950s (i hope that i worded that right). it focused on some hard topics while still staying in the young adult range. i loved it.  Cute romance with a brilliant historical background. It's been a long time since I enjoyed the end of the book so much. I love contemporary queer romances but it's just something about forbidden, secret love stories from the past that grabs my heart. Baby gays go to gay bar and fall in love ❤️ I really liked this one. It was also a bit sad bc it's a gay story set in the 50s so of course it is. It has a happy ending though.CW: racism, homophobia, threats of deportation I loved this book!! I really liked the romance I thought Kath and Lily were adorable but I thought it was also really interesting to read about a lesbian couple in 1954 when it was deemed “unnatural” and also learning a bit about the Chinese history.  awhhh this book was so cute, more like a 4.5. I loved all the details and writing style of the author. The relationships were perfect and i liked the flashbacks to Lily’s mom and her aunt. (I love Aunt Judy!!!) and i like the little timelines y’know. The epilogue was a great way to end the book and im glad how it ended.   i don’t think there are words to describe how much i loved this book. the representation along with the story and the characters, just everything that made this book so perfect for me. i resonated so deeply with lily and she was able to define so many things for me even just as a character written on paper. i really don’t know how else to talk about this book other than i loved it and everyone needs to read it.   Very sweet and cute coming of age lesbian YA book. I gasped, I cried, I loved it. I will also be reading the companion novel when it comes out. Loved the lesbian history elements, the love for butches, the main characters struggles with race and sexuality. 🤌🤌🤌 This book was absolutely beautiful from start to finish. I felt as if each word was hand selected to be on the page. Such a divine story filled with real exploration, joy, sorrow, and somehow optimism. A new favorite and will be my new go to recommendation to anyone and everyone.  4.25/5 bardzo mnie wciągnęła w pewnym momencie (do tego stopnia, że nie mogłam się oderwać). Uwielbiam główną bohaterkę; i wish her all the best. Klimat też całkiem fajny, więc tu vibes niż faktycznej fabuły co nie przemówi do każdego, ale mi się podobało. Bardzo doceniam to ile pracy zostało włożone w tę powieść - z tyłu jest bibliografia???  I absolutely loved this to start with 🤕maybe it’s cuz of exams and so I didn’t pick it up for months and when I did I’d read like 3 pages every few days. but i just found it boring, I was expecting to love this &amp; give it 5 stars but after about 100 pages I feel like nothing interesting was happening. The ending was very underwhelming too I have so many questions   I loved this story. The rich historical detail, believable characters, exploration of intersectional identities, romance, and sense of place all worked beautifully, I thought. Best book I’ve read so far this year. I read this in an evening and really enjoyed it. My heart hurt so much for Lily.CW: homophobia, outing, racism, racial slurs, toxic friendship, sexism, previous miscarriage, sexual content, alcohol, war very very good. the first 15-ish chapters were so slow and took forever to read but the rest was pretty good and overall i am a big fan of it. the representation was saur cute although the flashbacks to lily's aunt and parents were kinda unneeded but they were nice ig. Honestly DNF but not because anything was wrong with the book. I tried and I just couldn't get into the story. I think the author is great and the subject is fine, I just couldn't push myself through the time period. I might try again later This was cute, but the pacing was really bad imo. The book is incredibly slow and then it suddenly rushes towards its end, with an epilogue that almost reads like a summary of 5-6 chapters all mashed up together. A pity because the book itself isn’t bad at all. okay I'm gonna allow myself to temporarily dnf this and see how I feel cause its just SO SLOW and tbh I haven't liked any of malinda los books very much before... idk there's nothing wrong with it and I do find it interesting historically but i just never find myself wanting to pick it up either.... welp on to the next one for now!(2022 10 10)  very much enjoyed this book! i had to take a break because it was slightly stressing me out LOL but a good one nonetheless. definitely enjoyed reading through the lens of lily’s intersecting identities, especially as they correspond in the 50s 3.5 stars ~I really enjoyed the second half of the book and related a lot with the fears Lily had. I do wish that Kath and Lily had more time together to develop their relationship, but even so the book focuses more on Lily’s experiences as she learns about herself. Also, the ending was definitely way too abrupt for me; I need more!!  The kind of book that reminds you how wonderful reading is. I left wanting SO much more of Lily and Kath’s story, but maybe that’d be true no matter what. The audio book is a treat in itself, and l found it added to the narration in delightful ways. I had to switch to paperback for the last quarter though because it was too suspenseful!I would like many more books like this, please! The kind of book I wish existed when I was a teen, and I’m so glad exists now.   Dobrze napisana książka, z ciekawymi postaciami i można się z niej wiele nauczyć. Nie rozumiem w jaki celu pojawiły się niektóre retrospekcje z życia różnych członków rodziny lily, tylko rozumem generalny zamysł. Generalnie jest warta kupienia jej nawet w cenie okładkowej. Well… what isn’t there to love about this tale of “forbidden” love. A beautifully written historical fiction, Last Night at the Telegraph Club perfectly captures the innocence and passion of a first love. A gay love story set in the 1950s with dual time zones, multiple POVS… with a heavy focus on space/science… what isn’t to love?!  okej wow….. nie wiem jakich slow uzyc aby precyzyjnie przekazac moje wrazenia. dawno zadna ksiazka nie sprawila ze poczulam tak wiele emocji - od ogromnego szczescia do wielkiego smutku. kocham historie lily, kocham to w jaki sposob zostala przedstawiona. przepiekna, niezwykle wazna ksiazka&lt;33  Książka była strasznie wolna i monotonna przez co strasznie się wynudziłam. Miałam wrażenie że większość książki było tylko wstępem do zakończenia. Ostatecznie zostawiam 4 gwiazdki bo była to naprawdę piękna historia tyle że raczej nie „moja”. The pacing was slow but it really worked in the character's favour. It leant so much more to the impact of societal attitudes of the 1950s on LGBT+ people/ relationships. This gave me big feelings and upon finishing it, I cried (as if I wasn't already some chapters earlier) and immediately went to look for more of Malinda Lo's work.  It was a great story of accepting yourself and finding others who accept you. I really liked the middle/ending, but, in my opinion, the beginning was a bit slow. It took too long to develop a premise that was apparent from the very start, but it was still a very good book. Another minor complaint: Some characters were brought up, seemingly important to the plot, and never appeared again. This made the ending somewhat unsatisfying.  i love the way books of other cultures/time periods/genders point out the differences in perspective and the universal perspective of the human experience. everyone wants to love, everyone wants to feel safe, everyone wants a home and a story. i love when authors can pinpoint these feelings and tap at them until you realize the same truths in yourself. i love   3.5 nice read :)The love story had me blushing on the train 😖I really likes the inclusion of the flashbacks because it made the world seem much larger (weird to call it the world since it's historical fiction though LOL)ALSO the inclusion of the intrusive thoughts in parentheses was very cool! It made the characters feel so much more real and felt like you were truly in their heads  4.5/5 stars.I adored this book!! RTC. this book made me cry at 9 in the morning 3.5* I’ve waited for months for this book to come out and now. I. Am. Just. Broken.  I adore this book and I adore lily hu4.5 stars I want every queer teen to read this book. Heck, every teen and adult should read this book. It’s authentic and beautiful and perfect. lots of happy tears Malinda Lo further solidifies her place as one of my all-time favourite authors. I feel so blessed that my first intentional foray into WLW fiction was with her Huntress. Such a fascinating look at the Chinese American and lesbian experience in the 1950s in San Francisco. Tried to read it but it was too slow... once I switched to audio, I really enjoyed it! What a book. My God, what a book.  not bad, but a lot of unnecessary details made it too long for my taste.  This book made my heart grow two sizes bigger 4.5 rounded up. Loved the fullness of the story, didn't like the flashbacks. 4/5 starsvery very beautiful &lt;3 would highly recommend wow. what a novel.  4.5! This was so well written and one of my favorite reads so far this year!! A perfect combination of so many things: historical novel, coming of age, sexual identity. It’s really a perfect YA novel.  damn, i hate everyone in this book except the gays. anyway, my best sapphic so far this yr.5 ☆ (3.75) mild spoilers - nothing too significant a book full of amazing representation and a lesbian storyline that doesn’t have a tragic ending. a win !!! i do think it could’ve been written better. don’t ask me how bc idk  4.5!! Tbh I don’t know why I took 2 MONTHS!! to finish because overall it was amazing. But, I feel frustrated with the ending. I need more. i'm to lazy to actually write something but this book was literally so good. the writing and characters were all so amazing and its the first romance book i didn't cringe at. 10/10 would recommend  Absolutely adored this. Slow, but very soft and romantic. Fantastic writing, great historical detail. Just overall super great.  I really wanted to love this book but the lack of relationship development and just plot in general made me give it 3⭐️ the idea was a good one but the execution was not done well  it doesn’t have a terrible ending, which is surprising, because it’s a sapphic love story set in the 1950s i absolutely adored this book although the chapters in part vi were very tough to read (im aware it was the whole purpose but still) First read of 2022!This book has been on my list for ages and I finally received it for Christmas and it was clear to me that this has to be my first book in the new year. I was very happy with my choice, even though I went in with the wrong expectations.Through consumption of multiple videos I was led to believe that this would be a romance story - and while there are certainly romance elements, I wouldn’t call this a romance book but more a coming-of-age story. I really enjoyed the relationship between Lily and Kath and grew more worried about the friendship between Lily and Shirley with ever page I read. I can’t say how realistic the story truly is, because I didn’t live in the 50s, I’m not Chinese and I don’t live anywhere near the US/San Francisco, but the story certaily *felt* real. My biggest critique though has to be that nothing felt like it had real consequences. (Spoilers ahead!)First: The stuff about communism. I have to admit, I don’t know anything about the way communism was handled in the 50s, especially not with Chinese deportations. But when it was first mentioned it felt like it would be this big thing and have great consequences... only to be never mentioned again. (Not really never, but you know what I mean). Lily’s father having his papers taken away didn’t change anything in the story. It was only there to add to the conflict between Lily and Shirley, but it wasn’t really necessary. Second: Lily sneaking out to the Telegraph Club. I expected her to be caught tbh. I’m gald she wasn’t though. I know she was spotted but that could’ve been easily deniable if Lily didn’t decide otherwise. Third: Lily telling her family that she was “like them” (the lesbians at the club). Her having to go with her aunt in the end wasn’t really a consequence but a blessing. I’m sure she didn’t see it that way but Aunt Judy truly was the true MVP of this story. Stan Aunt Judy.The ending was very open, but that leaves room for imagination! The open ending itself didn’t bother me at all but it came rather aprubt.All in all this was a beautiful story about friendship finding oneself in a time where it was difficult to be yourself, if you were a women, gay or Chinese (especially if you’re all three) and I really enjoyed Lily as a main character and the relationships she formed.  This book makes me feel closer to San Francisco, the city, and I appreciate it very much for that. 3.75 stars.  A beautiful book that allowed you to jump back in time. It was a little long, but her writing style was beautiful and the story was very moving  4.5* I-this book wrapped me up in so much. I loved it to pieces. As the kids say, perfect, no notes. This book is full of rich historical detail, fully realized characters, and real gay emotions. (3.5) good but not great. there was kind of a lot of filler and it seemed to be meandering at times. the whole middle of the book i was just waiting for something to happen. still worth the read this book broke my heart and stitched it back up every time I picked it up to read. it has skyrocketed to the very top of my list of favorite books—and I will be thinking about it for a long, long time. DNF @ 16% on 2/9/2022 Unlikely to return to this. I just couldn’t connect to the stories or characters.  A historical lesbian romance about her first lesbian love. I liked this more than I thought I would  This book was good but not completely what I expected, which isn't inherently good or bad. I respect the ending and how it wasn't typical because of how more realistic it is. It's an important read and has good literary devices, but it's not an intense page turner. This book mentions the red scare once in the summary, and just about once in the actual book. I do not understand why it's mentioned in the summary, it's such a minor part of the book. 4/5 stars historical fiction sapphic books hit different ❤️‍🩹 4.5 stars sandy if you see this no you didn’t  bom, mas parece incompleto… eu esperava algo mais com a família dela I love this book, I just wish lilys family was more accepting! but it is the 1950s so I'll let it pass. who is going to become the Lily for my kath? A delightful read I plan to put into many people’s hands! Would recommend to anyone who wants to read about the San Francisco Bay &amp; California or is fond of butch/femme or loves Asian American history or rocket ships or teen romance or good books.  i could not stop reading this! such a beautiful story that has aspects of relatability for so many, added with the illumination of discrimination so common in the 50s and sadly even now.  This queer Chinese-American-coming-of-age-McCarthyism-in-SF feels very fresh and complete. Also, I am very much an HEA kind of reader, and thank god for this one. detailed: that’s the word i was thinking the whole time while reading this book. it was incredible!!!! i’m a sucker for queer period pieces, so this was right up my alley. go read it. 3.5 starsThis book turned out to be something very different from what I was expecting, and I'm still not sure if I would have rated it higher and it would have taken me less than almost a month to finish it if it came along at a different time. It certainly keeps appearing on all sorts of "Must Read" lists, and seems both critically acclaimed and highly rated by regular readers. The book description tells us that it's going to be the forbidden love story of two young women in 1950s San Francisco, but while the book also features a Chinese American woman gradually realising that she's falling for one of her classmates, and them sneaking out at night to visit a lesbian bar, it seems almost like a subplot. Lily's identity as a lesbian is a lot less focused on than her place as a Chinese American, bound between personal wishes and desires, and the duty to her family and community, growing up in a paranoid society where the government is in a panic, hunting Communists everywhere. Lily's father is a respected doctor, but he nevertheless has his papers taken away because he refuses to confirm or deny one way or another that one of his patients is a Communist. Lily's mother is a nurse, deeply concerned with propriety and making sure that their family's reputation is spotless. Lily's Chinese American friends all only seem interested in dresses, older boys, and dating, while she wants to study advanced math and science and dreams of becoming an engineer, and maybe even going to space one day. The only other girl in her advanced math class, Catholic Kath Miller wants to be a mechanic and a pilot, not exactly your traditional career path for a young woman in the 1950s either. Lily initially strikes up the friendship with Cath because they are the only two girls in their class, but it's revealed late in the book that Cath was aware of and taken with Lily long before they actually became friends, and later more.This was the Cannonball Book Club book for May, when the theme was AAPI (Asian American and Pacific Islander) writers. We had a vote to decide on the book, and this was my first choice, exactly because I had read and heard so much about it, and thanks yet again to e-book sales, I already had the book on my e-reader. As it turned out, the rather slow start and the somewhat tense subject matter (minority protagonist with a traditional family has homosexual stirrings) meant that when we had out Zoom book club meeting, every single reader had peaked ahead to the ending to see whether it ended in misery or not. If this was a YA romance, that would not be necessary, but the romantic subplot takes second place in Lily's coming of age narrative. Her discovering who she is, what she stands for and who she wants to be going forward is the centre plot of the book. In the post scripts at the end of the book, the author mentions that this was a very personal book to her, and it's obvious both from the postscripts and the story that she'd done a ton of research. So much of the research she's done is felt in the writing, to the point that if time travel is ever invented and I happen to end up in 1950s Chinatown in San Francisco, I'll be able to find my way around just fine entirely based on the descriptions in this book. Obviously, part of the joy of reading historical fiction is experiencing another time and place, but here, it did feel a bit as if the author also wanted to make sure that every single piece of historical trivia she'd discovered ended up on the page somehow, a bit to the detriment of the flow of the story. This may also be one of those YA books where reading it as an adult becomes a very different experience, because I personally, and pretty much all the others who were reading this for Cannonball book club agreed that the flashback chapters featuring the older characters, Lily's father, mother and aunt, were absolutely fascinating and we wanted more of their stories. So Malinda Lo could probably have a loyal following of fans buying her book about Chinese immigrants to America in the 1950s, as well. The chapters giving us insight into the older generations' lives and perhaps especially what their hopes and expectations had been in contrast to where they ended up were fascinating. This is my first book by Malinda Lo. I know she's written several fairy tale retellings with LGBTQ-themes, as well, so I'm sure it will not be the last of her books that I try.Judging a book by its cover: The absolutely gorgeous cover of this book is one of the first things that drew me to it. It captures the scene and place of the story so perfectly and the contrast between the dark San Francisco streets and the bright neon signs, not to mention the one lamp post illuminating our two lovers is so pretty. I could easily have this cover as a poster for my wall.  4.5 ⭐️This book was gorgeous. An absolute masterpiece. I adore queer historical fiction, and thoroughly enjoyed the historical research element of the book. Lily had a lot of relatability, but it dropped half a star because I felt like her character arc is a little rushed for the pacing of the book.Overall, I would and have recommended this to friends and I will be rereading.  This book is so incredible. Easily a new classic for our time 5/5 stars.This was the best book I could’ve possibly picked up for pride month. I can’t explain how important this book is for the queer, POC community.  so good This book is beautiful and heartbreaking and hopeful all at once.  So good! So gay! So beautiful! So San Francisco! I would say this is more new adult than young adult? Maybe? But so so good. Love love love. Delightful queer Chinese American story set in 1950s San Francisco. Need more like this! Unfortunately I have to give this book only two stars. This is because I found it very uninteresting the first 300 pages. The last 100 pages were actually quite good, because things happened… finally. I’m sad that this book was under my expectations because the subject is very important and it’s a beautiful love story.   historical fiction sapphics you will always be famous to me  Okay this is definitely the queer historical romance I’ve been waiting for  Hmm was fine and like a sweet book but didn't get into it, think writing was a bit too obvious and a bit too YA? Ended up taking ages to finish it 🤷🏼‍♀️ wish I loved it more ☹️ Sweet, utterly predictable, and exactly what I needed: a reminder that queer and non-conforming women have always been here, scraping happiness out of the world. A book like this (with very little plot) lives or dies on its characters, and I was entranced by all of them; even the background characters are sketched in a way that suggests more complex interiority than the teenage protagonist can see.  I don’t like YA 4.5 ⭐️ One of my fav books ever maybe????????? not me crying in the club. Sooooo good.  Thought-provoking and unique premise, but I had such high expectations I was a bit disappointed. 3.5 stars loved it 😌 Now I remember! Historical Fiction can be really good! This book gets so many things right, and I felt so inside the story.  INCREDIBLE 😭🥺🥰🙈🥳🌈🌈🥲 Wholesome little story yet bumpy and realistic. Although i feel like this book is predictable and a deja vu, I overall really enjoyed reading it. Beautiful. took quite some time reading this book bc idk i was distracted and it was pretty slow for most part but wow in the end i loved it. u can tell there was a lot of research and heart put into the book, i loved that the author explained in details all its real inspirations too and how they intertsect !  Esse livro se tornou o meu livro favorito, ele é tão precioso.Eu o amo pelo que ele é, e pelo que ele significa para mim, representando não só o amor das personagens, mas o amor que sinto pela pessoa mais especial.17/08  lesbian historical fiction is my cup of tea THIS BOOKit broke my heart into millions of little pieces.RTC Rtc So cute it hurts.  Simply amazing and incredibly well researched. Adore. 3,5 pourquoi sa passion c’est les fusées  so cute I'm not sure if this book's writing style is for me, but I still think it's an incredibly well researched and constructed novel. Lo's dedication to both historical context, and creating a story for someone in the margins of lesbian community and whiteness is incredible. I wish there was more dedication to Lily's desires coming forth in the Telegraph Club.  dnf @ 30%its just not gripping me guys i finally finished a book To have been a lesbian Asian American in the McCarthy era must have been terrifying as Lily testifies in this intensely gripping novel absolutny must read Really great. I liked how the book explored different communities, both lesbians and Chinese-Americans. The thread it drew between the oppression they were both facing, and the different historical boundaries that they were met with, added a lot of depth to the book. The one thing I would say, and this is just me, but I wasn’t super connected to any character besides Kath and Lily. I saw what the author was trying to do with the brief historical chapters of members of Lily’s family, but for me, at least, it just muddled the story, and I found myself reading those faster so I could get back to what I saw as the main story. Overall really really good read!  4,5 Read this for my Bates book club! Would recommend! 3.75 This was absolutely beautiful, I can’t even describe it. I just, yeah, I loved it. i think this was a really good representation of minorities and it had such an informative and cute story between characters dnf / 28% •skończyło mi się Legimi 💔🙈Nie byłam zachwycona ale czuję, że ma potencjał więc na pewno do niej wrócę.  that was amazing! i’ll be recovering from it for the rest of my life 4.5⭐️ oh my godi’m speechless. i love lily and kath and fuck all kinds of prejudices. 4.5 ⭐️estou sem palavras, isto puxou me de uma forma(por mais notas de autora assim pls… e traduções tbm) I want gay people to be HAPPY 4.5 stars ⭐ 2.5 4 ⭐️ i loved it but the ending felt unfinished i needed more ☹️ nie na moje nerwy I’ll write an actual review once I stop crying. God this was beautiful and absolutely everything.  3.75!! ja men ja! hemlig lesbisk klubb! 50-tal! kärlek!  esse livro podia ter pelo menos 150 páginas a menos e mesmo assim conseguiu ter um final corrido e pouco desenvolvidono geral achei legalzinho, é uma história bem original 3.75 stars That was a m a z i n g. 😭 Thank you for coming to my TED Talk 3.5 stars  This was so well researched (the Author's note might have been my favourite part) but Lily &amp; Kath were such two-dimensional characters and the book was so long-winded. i love gay ppl! A really beautiful story that touches on so many important things. I can’t wait to add this to my classroom library. Honnêtement on s'ennuie tout le début du livre j'ai mis genre 8 mois à passer les 200 premières pages mais c'était worth it. Ça mérite son 4☆ (et oui même si la moitié est boring) par ce que le reste est excellent + j'ai appris bcp bcp de choses donc merci pour les travaux. Je reste quand même un peu sur ma faim, je voulais en savoir un peu plus sur le futur de my girl Lily et la police anti communiste des us évoquée que très brièvement. Quand même bravo les lesbiennes, en espérant que Shirley ait une vie MISÉRABLE. I want her burried alive and now, quelle tocarde. A heart breakingly beautiful book THIS BOOK IS SO SWEETbittersweet! the author interviewed kitty tsui!!!! boring. need to stop trying to read YA 1) this hit a little too close to home towards the end2) really great story3) im not sure if this is ya but it sure is written like it  I liked it a lot but too many San Francisco street names it reminded me how terrible I am at geography  i loved the romance in this, i just wish there was more. it started off slow asf and then there were a BUNCH of flashbacks that i couldn’t really get myself to give a fuck about. i cared for the characters it just needed more smut and less flashbacks imo. i &lt;3 kath and lily tho 5✨ Thanks for making me cry in a starbucks  maybe my expectations were too high but the whole book was very underwhelming (especially the ending). still 3 stars just for lily hu my little lesbian princess🧸❤️‍🩹☹️ screaming crying ripping my hair out because of this book, definitely recommend  absolutely gut wrenching  CHCĘ WIĘCEJ TERAZ 3/5nastawilam sie na cos totalnie innegoepilog mnie niesamowicie zdenerwowal this book was amazing i loved it sm, i kinda wish it would have ended a little differently but i still loved it either way.  ma moje serce ta książka Lately, I have been in a book rut, and I feel like this book had everything I am looking for in a high-quality, engaging read. This has some interesting themes but overall I found it really slow. There were some odds flashbacks to Lily’s parent lives that weren’t very connected to the story. Just OK for me.  I'm obsessed. I love a historical fiction book where I actually learn about history. So goooood 3.5/5 λίγο αργό, αλλά σίγουρα όμορφο και γεμάτο αξιόλογες πληροφορίες. Ήταν μια ιστορία ενηλικίωσης και αναζήτησης της ταυτότητας σε ένα περιβάλλον γεμάτο προκαταλήψεις και αποθάρρυνση. Μου άρεσε! 🌼 4.5 stars - this was SO good!! I did find that it was a bit of a slow start, but the last 150 pages were so easy to breeze-through!!  This book is so well-researched in its portrayal of a teenage Chinese girl growing up during the Red Scare. She discovers her love of her friend, Kath and the appeal of male impersonators &amp; lesbian bars. And even though it was written in the 1950s, there are still trends that run true to current times. The obsession with American beauty cultural standards ("Miss Chinatown" contests) and the inability to accept a family member who is gay because of outside judgement or fear that this means an unhappy and unfulfilling life. Lo wrote her characters with such heart and strength. This was another of my "Reads of Acceptance" book club from the local library system.  dnf 4.5⭐️  Ok I really wanted to rate this 3.5 stars but alas goodreads. I enjoyed the characters exploration and how we were able to follow them through their journey but I got decently invested and I want to know more about after they found each other again — these one year later epilogues aren’t the most satisfying sometimes  Najlepsza książka wlw jaką kiedykolwiek czytałam AAAAAAAA JEST IDEALNA this is probably going to become a comfort read  The writing is so detailed, I felt like I knew what was going on everywhere at all times which made my whole ~reading experience~ very immersive (in a good way!). Some content warnings: homophobia, racism and racial slurs  um the writing pulled at my heart !! thoroughly enjoyed this 🥺  Absolutely loved this book.  (4.5) awesome, immersive historical fiction and beautifully written lesbian romance. i loved everything about the characters and setting. the ending seemed a bit rushed and unfinished but the rest of the book makes up for it  a lovely book full of so much longing. i loved loved loved every scene at the telegraphic club, a place that felt so fully realized, lived in, and welcoming.  4.5 stars. tell me why they're so cute. 4.5 rounded to 5! This was a really great book, with a particularly unique POV. Read this on audio and it was super enjoyable. Aaaaaah I zoomed through this. So good. this book took me so long to read but it was so good If God hates gen Z sapphics why do they keep winning so okay this was really good but also the ending was so sad and a little rushed imo? the main story was chefs kiss excellent but the flashbacks were just confusing. still loved it tho Wow, this book made me laugh, cry, smile and I'm leaving with expectations of love that are way too high. I was scared towards the end ngl but I really live the way the end of this book was structured and ugh the writing was just beautiful.It handled culture and traditional values faced with queerness so well and everytime I put this book down I wanted to pick it up again-thank you for getting it for me Naomi lmao this needs a special thanks &lt;33~ Ellie &lt;3  more story about old timer sapphic bipoc please romances históricos lgbt são tudo pra mim se eu pudesse dava 6 estrelas  4.5 Exceptionally written❣️❣️❣️ I am the main character and the main character is me. The buildup of hope, only for it to be shattered in the last 100 pages, the lead up to the bittersweet ending. The weaving of the Asian American aspects with the lgbtq+ ones 🛐🛐. Sheer perfection that can never be replicated. The bibliography, the research put into the creation of this masterpiece, the historical explanations for everything 🤌🤌✨✨I will forever be craving the experience this book has given me. Good lord 🍏📖🐀💕❗️  4.5* Very Very important story, in terms of sexuality and race. However, it made me hella sad!!  Totally lives up to the hype.  Bawled my eyes out I love gay people read half of it in a day  I didn't understand the need for the flashbacks, and the ending was a little rushed, but overall a good story. Bumping up my rating from 4 to 5 stars because I haven’t been able to stop thinking about this book since I finished it. Last Night at the Telegraph Club touched my heart in a way not many books have. Such a beautiful, heartbreaking &amp; infuriating read. I enjoyed learning about American/Chinese history &amp; queer culture in the 1950s too.  2 stars because decent representation is hard to come across in ya books, but this lowkey felt like one of those books i would read in 3 hours and then never think about again i don't even like politics 3.5 esse livro despertou muitas emoções dentro de mim… chorei o final inteiro do livro! é muito triste ver como nós (LGBTQIA+) somos violentados de várias formas durante nossa existência, como nós nos “acostumamos” as micro agressões pra “sofrer menos”, como as coisas ditas na década de 50 ainda são as mesmas ainda em 2022… enfim, ainda muito emocionada com a leitura  Może minimalnie naciągana piątka, ale naprawdę bardzo mi się podobało i to jedna z lepszych książek, jakie przeczytałam w ostatnich miesiącach.Mam mieszane uczucia jedynie do retrospekcji: z jednej strony podoba mi się, że czytelnik może chociaż częściowo poznać przeszłość niektórych postaci, ale z drugiej to przez te rozdziały nie mogłam przebrnąć, bo zaburzały mi główną akcję.Dodatkowym plusem jest posłowie autorki i tłumaczki, wykonały kawał dobrej roboty.  Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful czuję, że się nie czuję. po pierwsze shirley to pizda :) po drugie ile ta książka spowodowała na mnie emocji to jest jedno wielkie wow. sto ostatnich stron to był ryk za każdym razem. no i ten kocham eddiego, słodziak z niego największy 🥹 Maybe a 4.5 but a 5 star in my heart because I just loved this books Book Club and book club discussion 4.75 ⭐️ A queer historical love story set in one of the best cities in the world. What’s not to love?  4.5 stars!!!Ahhh I loved this book. It was the perfect mix of history and romance. I haven’t read a historical fiction in a while and I thought this was fantastic. By the end of the book I was fully aware of how important this representation would be for so many people. I also really enjoyed reading and learning about both Asian-American and lesbian history in the 1950’s. In terms of the characters, Lily has my heart. There were moments in this book where I was tearing up, from both happiness and sadness. And in my head Lily and Kath are together forever… that’s final :)  This is the story of Lily who is an Asian American teen in the 1950s. She lives in the Chinatown area of San Francisco and has a best friend named Shirley. One day Lily and Shirley were grouped up with two other people in order to do a class assignment. One of those other teens is a girl named Kathleen who ends up being the catalyst of change in Lily’s life. This book is that story.  good but I need more closure😭😭Her father was deported and she doesn’t even mention it in the epilogue?? ouch, my heart "her brown eyes full of the sharp worry of love, and Lily thought, you will never look at me like this again" ESTOY MUY TRISTE fue hermoso, divertido, desgarrador,i blushed i giggled and i cried amo a las lesbianas y merecemos tanto ser felices  tears 🥹  truly one of the greatest books i ever read. it's so simple yet so beautiful. This is such an engaging book, I could barely put it down! We follow a Chinese American girl named Lily who realizes that she likes girls, as she navigates not only the homophobia of that time period but also the assumptions made about Chinese people and queer people back then.The book comes across as very well-researched, and it was interesting to see how ethnocentric the assumptions Americans made about Chinese people were, as well as how scared people were of communism to the point where if even one person is suspected of being a communist, people are warning each other about them.   Big fan :) the characters were good and the pacing was perfect, basically no complaints  I am so glad this book exists. It is very obvious that Malinda Lo put a lot of effort and love into writing this. 100% recommend both broke my heart and made me feel much less alone. 100% recommended The lesbian romance I’d been waiting for.  A love story to San Francisco, a love story between two young women, a love story to Chinese Americans and a historical look at 1950s queer culture and the McCarthy era - has poignant and beautiful moments while feeling scattered and leaving the reader asking a lot of questions.   screaming crying etc 3.5 starsthe flashbacks felt a bit clunky and the main characters didn’t have very much chemistry. also shirley and lily’s relationship was incredibly confusing. that being said, i really enjoyed reading this one, and the bits of history that i learned from this book made it all the more interesting.  Ik kon het boek simpelweg niet neerleggen. Zo leerzaam en uniek en romantisch, het is een van die boeken die je toevallig vindt en nog jaren zal onthouden gay! but sad.  it was so good i genuinely don't know what to say  I AM IN LOVE 😭😭 i adore everything about this book holy shit i wanna reread already 4.5☆One thing that will stay with me from this book is how EVERY WORD IS A CHOICE WE MAKE (over and over and again and again) when we open up to someone. Always. But the choice is ours. Really nice book.Ups and downs. Open ending. Realisticly homofobic family and friends. A lovely and cruel reality.  dying out here ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ DNF/5 Stars: ‘Last Night at the Telegraph Club’ by Malinda Lo.→ Age Range: Young Adult.→ Genre: LGBT+, Historical Fiction.→ Book Type: Novel. Favourite Quote: ‘Haven’t you ever wondered what it would be like to have nothing keeping you attached to the ground?’In-depth Rating:→ Plot: ★→ Character Development: ★→ Setting: ★→ Entertainment Level: ★→ Writing: ★General Comments: A beautifully written historical fiction about giddy, queer first love. It sensitively tells of young women in 1950s San Francisco. Unfortunately, the story was not memorable. It became difficult to pick up; connecting to the characters was challenging, nothing particularly was happening. The characters felt underdeveloped and flat. The historical and cultural aspects were, without a doubt, the most interesting parts. Continuing on felt more of a chore.Time Read: Nine Days.→ Audiobook: No.→ Audiobook Narrator: -Re-Read: No.→ -:→ -:Trigger Warnings:→ Sexism (Misogyny).→ Racism.→ Lesbomisia.  assembling a lily and kath protection squad  it took me so long to get into this book and it just samantha my favorite. good tho! just personally not my favorite imo.  jeeez these characters are so stressed out it made me stressed out. I feel like the YA part and all the high school coming of age was just too much for me this month 😅 i’m so sad and my heart aches for lily and kathsuch a beautiful read, imma cry myself to sleep now Väldigt gripande och så intressant (och väl-researchad) miljö!  i have never felt so seen by a character like i did with lily  Everything lovely I’ve heard about this book from reviews is true. A wonderful heartfelt story of lesbian community in the 50s U.S. and first love.  A beautiful book; heartfelt and poignant.  this book made me feel empty This book is so beautiful and evocative. I've never read anything quite like it and I can't recommend it enough. it’s gay, it has found family, and it’s historical fiction. naturally i loved it I am actually sobbing uncontrollably because this book is painfully relatable. On one hand it’s beautiful and the romance is adorable to watch but on the other it’s so bleak and upsetting that this might be all I have in store for me in my future ANYWAYS I HATE IT HERE  3,5 stars A really nice book. I couldn’t get 100% into it but I still enjoyed reading it.  Review to come. so good LET’S GO LESBIANS LET’S GO i am not well emotionally after reading this amazing book with great insights really wanted to like this one bc i heard a lot of good abt it. and it certainly has its strong points!! found all the historical stuff pretty interesting, i definitely learned a few things. but other than that, it wasnt what i expected and hoped it would be. i think my main issue is that most characters felt somewhat hollow to me. i think there was a lot of wasted potential there bc a lot of the characters did appear intriguing to me, like the girls at the telegraph club and lilys family. but i feel like we never get to know them beyond a few surface level facts. its kind of why the flashbacks annoyed me so much bc i was curious abt the side characters but even these glimpses into their past didnt bring them to life for me. that made it very hard for me to care abt the relationships. the love story was kind of cute but so forgettable and the family drama just didn't hit at all for me bc i just didnt care abt the characters.i feel bad for my rating bc i do think its an important story to tell and it was interesting but i just didnt enjoy reading it that much sooo  Bardzo przyjemny, ale przede wszystkim, realny nastoletni romans, taki, który mógłby wydarzyć się naprawdę. Książka nie jest tak cukierkowo-słodka, tylko pokazuje też problemy tamtych czasów.Polecam Favorite book club pick ever(More thoughts soon) Love, love, loved this heartfelt, emotional, swoony historical fiction. A new favorite, a new classic.  IN TEARS SOBBING ON THE FLOOR THROWING UP AND DYING (I'm changing my rating from 4.5/5 to 5/5, because it was amazing) 5⭐/5This was great. This book successfully describes the atmosphere and political situation in the 1950's. (No, but literally, I got so hooked that I had a dream about it?) The author really did a research on historicaly accurate language, San Francisco, Chinatown and Chinese Americans and the lesbian comunity trough out history. Some parts felt unnecessary but overall, Lily's coming-of-age story was beautiful and I really enjoyed it.  This is a fascinating approach to historical fiction: exploring the intersection of a specific identity with a specific time and place. Instead of examining a big "event," Lo examines cultural ripples &amp; repercussions. I would love to read more historical fiction written in this vein.  Did I love the sweet, complex, and period specific sapphic romance? Yes. Did I also love the world building and sense of time and place of the novel? Yes. But I just wanted to give a special shout out to the 30 minute author's note that goes over the sources and historical context for the novel. There's a special place in my heart for both fiction and non-fiction historical works that look at "alternative" cultures, and I love hearing more about the basis for this story and all the cool books I can add to my to-read to learn more. Also anything narrated by Emily Woo Zeller is a treat.  Yet another novel I wish had been around when I was younger. I can’t sing its praises enough. A beautiful and poignant love story for the ages set during a time that not enough people know about. I will be recommending it to everyone I know.  Not sure what I can say about this book that hasn’t already been said, but the time + place + heart + soul of this book really impacted me. I feel more fervently than ever that Lily’s story needs to be read by all kids.  3.5/5A love letter to all queer Chinese women in STEM What a very special book!  So beautiful and interesting!! Taught me a lot about a time period I did not know that much about, whilst also being a beautiful love story at heart.  4.5This book is nearly perfect. It’s a book about discovery, adventure and love. It’s so pure and hopeful and frustrating.It was so beautiful, this story, these characters. The last few pages brought tears to my eyes.  lesbians i love you Started off super slow but the end def made up for it. This book caught me in my feelzz which bumped this book up a star imo 3.5. Ik weet niet. Misschien dat ik hier gewoon te weinig achtergrondkennis over had ofzo. Ik begreep het hele communisme deel niet helemaal. T was een goed boek, begrijp me niet verkeerd, maar t verliep gewoon te langzaam voor mij, zelfs in de tijd waarin t zich afspeelt. A historical lesbian fiction set in San Fran’s Chinatown written by the formidable Malinda Lo? Sign me up, now and always!  3.5 if I could absolutely beautiful and so layered - a fantastic read!!! 3.5 ⭐️ i loved this book so much, but it was also sad, it really put in perspective how people where treated back then for being gay, it’s ridiculous really and i blows my mind how people saw it back then. anyways i loved the relationship in this book and the self discovery!! fair warning this book does have scenes of homophobia in it ‼️‼️‼️  3.5/5 an important book. don't think i enjoyed it that much because it ranges somewhere between middle-grade and YA level both writing and plot-wise. a much-needed story though. absolutely loved. probably one of the best sapphic books i’ve ever read and so thrilling  Interesting perspective, I'm not sure about plot consistency but the writing was compelling and had fascinating characters. 3.5Great when it's on, but it's a little slow at times, and I reckon it could have done without the parental flashbacks. The writing itself was very stylish, and thoughtful. The political landscape was interesting, though at times seemed not to go anywhere or do anything for the story. Maybe it's just me. Happy to have read it, at any rate!  Some moments in this book were almost unbearably relatable, this truly is a story about first love and discovering yourself in your teenage years. I sort of saw the ending coming but I didn't know exactly how it would play out. Lily was a really interesting perspective to read from as a Chinese American lesbian during the red scare. The intersectionality of her identities was well explained and well developed but I think Lo could have done more with Lily's fear of communism.  i had high expectations for this one so i’m supremely disappointed :// ok so yes it took me forever to finish the book but the ending genuinely disappointed me…. How do we go from heartbreak to hope to heartbreak again ??? What was the reason The main part was really good, I loved everything about being different, and especially queer, in the era of Mccarthyism, super interestingI have no idea why the rest of the flashbacks were included, they had no payoff that I understoodWhat can I say I'm a sucker for love in the face of the world  4.5, loved this book so much! rtc—review:i have really high standards for YA so i was happily surprised by how much i enjoyed this read!i loved the premise so so much, and i think the strongest aspect of Malinda Lo’s writing is the atmospheric prose. the way Lo brings 1950s san francisco to life is so evocative. also i like her style so much, it’s poetic without being contrived or purply.i also think the balance is great, in that Lo incorporates various arcs surrounding family, community, love, friendship, and political/racial anxieties—all making for a very well-rounded plot with rises and falls across each. there was always some part of the story keeping me hooked.this wasn’t a perfect book by any means—the characters did sometimes feel more like archetypes, although i think that’s just a tendency in historical fiction. also i wish there was more of a tie-in for the other characters’ POVs besides the “time moves in circles” message. i was really expecting the aunt’s backstory to line up with lily’s in the end but it didn’t exactly end up culminating to anything.but overall i think this book was so enjoyable and extremely touching, well-researched and really exciting because it touched on a lot of research topics and conceptual frameworks that i love to thing about! like in/visibility, spatiotemporalities, performance of identity, writing against the archive. ALSO appreciate that the relationship in this book is interracial for a specific reason that serves the plot, and isn’t just a asian-white relationship for literally no reason (i have more nuanced opinions on this, but like, i’m tired! sue me if i want to see more portrayals of asians with non-white people!)—AND that that dynamic is explored, especially in the context of queer spaces!please give us more sapphic 1950s asian am historical fiction, i loved this so much!!  dang “Perhaps that was the most perverse part of this: the inside-outness of everything, as if denial would make it go away, when it only made the pain in her chest tighten, when it only made her emotions clearer.”bittersweet and vivid. i haven't read a new malinda lo book in a while, and i'm glad to see that her writing has held up, as she was one of my fave authors in middle school/high school. lily was a really compelling protagonist, and i just felt for her so much and wanted to give her a hug throughout this entire book. i'm always a sucker for historical fiction, as i feel it tends to have really gorgeous prose and tons of detail packed throughout (although it obviously depends on the author), and so i liked this book quite bit. i wish we had gotten a little more from lily and kath's relationship, as i feel lily was quite well-developed while kath was a little more of a flat character whose primary purpose was to be lily's love interest. otherwise, though, i thought this was a very well-crafted novel.  So well written ! One of the best I’ve read in queer literature  I did not expect it to be so sad :((((((((((((((((((( I really thought there'd be happy lesbians through and through in a book set in the '50s. Sometimes I think, but this was not one of those times.TW: homophobia, orientalism, fetishization of Chinese women   4.5 stars! I want to scream about this book but it's not a 5 star because it took until the ending for me to be literally shouting at the events in the book. You all need to read this, please :) this was beautiful and deserves so much more hype and love. A wonderful testament to lesbian history and culture and I’m so happy it exists  4.5 ☆ 4.25so it was really good. I enjoyed it and felt like it stayed truer to the time period than i expected it to. I had expected it to be more romance focused but i feel like you will enjoy the novel more if u see it as more of a coming of age/ finding herself journey of Lily, and more of a commentary about issues at the time. I feel like the romance was used more as a tool to show the oppression and injustice. I really like that the author explored a lot of themes in this book, but i feel that she sorta had a few in there just for the purpose of being there and never really followed up on them much. Either way, I enjoyed the story and agree that it brings something very important to the table. Also wasn’t much of a fan of the open ended-ish ending bc i always want closure for my characters but honestly this kind of ending is the most accurate to real life bc there’s no for sure closure or endings irl so i guess it works out.A few parts around the end made me cry a little so.  this book was everything and nothing all in one. idk tbhalso the ending was fucking garbage. garbage. the is plotless and it loses you multiple times. like i like flashbacks but we don’t need all them damn flashbacks. it also gave no character analysis whatsoever but ok OMG, give this book ALL THE STARS and ALL THE AWARDS.How am I supposed to read something else now?Review to come once I've recovered from my book hangover. As far as LGBTQ YA goes, this was pretty good. It was a neat piece of historical fiction, the writing itself was lovely and included great metaphors, and the characters were convincing and sympathetic.  Such a well-told and much needed story! I hope this becomes classic literature in schools. I can't wait to read Lo's other books! I have... conflicting feelings about this book.First off, I really liked the representation. It's own voices Chinese lesbian rep and it's extremely heartwarming and so nice to see positive sapphic representation in media. I also loved the way the book switched between the perspectives of Lily's family members and herself, highlighting not only Lily's struggle with race and sexuality but a larger struggle with being Chinese American during the 1950s, and the conflicting identities that come with it. It made for a really insightful and intriguing read--I loved it.Something that rubbed me the wrong way throughout almost the entire book, and kind of ruined the main romance for me a little, is the way Kath reacted to Lily being faced with microaggressions constantly throughout the book. And by reacted, I mean didn't react at all. This is of course own voices representation and nothing can take away how important that is, but I just found it so frustrating to think that the main character's love interest, the one they are so deeply invested and in love with, never said a  thing  while Lily was made uncomfortable by other people's words against her as a Chinese girl in America. I feel as though the standards are just so low, and the fact that it was never addressed or brought up was a little disheartening.It was frustrating enough for me to bump this down from a 4-star to a 3-star rating, but I still think this is very much so a worthwhile book to read. The representation is great, and I especially loved the last 100 or so pages of the book. It has a happy lesbian couple in it, it talks about what it means to be Asian American, and how hard it can be to come to grips with the multiple identities you're faced with as a queer person of color. It's definitely worth a read.  RTC I’ve been putting off reviewing this book because I’m not sure if I have the right words to capture how good this book truly was. I always enjoy books that have some historical aspect to them and this one was really great because the author included a timeline of events that weaved in real events occuring in America as well as the main character’s or her family’s life events.I liked the main character quite a bit. She really grew into herself as the book progressed. Of course all the scenes at the Telegraph Club were so vivid and boistorous. Each time she went there was something new to experience.I think the author was able to tackle the subjects of immigrating to America as well as falling in love as a queer woman with a lot of grace. This book is so important for young readers, especially queer women of color to know that their stories are just as important as anyone else’s and that they too deserve space to be who they are, fully and completely.Characters: 8/10Atmosphere: 7/10Writing Style: 7/10Plot: 7/10Intrigue: 7/10Logic: 7/10Enjoyment: 7/10Rating: 7.1 or 4 stars  4.5* it might have taken me a while to really get into this book, but once I did it was over way too soon. I want more of this. Pain and suffering!! I really loved it, but had a hard getting through some of the backstory. The context is of course important, but I really wanted the main story.  refreshing but also familiar with a hint of tears The Last Night at the Telegraph Club is a wonderful mix of 1950s San Francisco, lesbian bars and subcultures, Chinese-American life, all set against the backdrop of the Red Scare. A bittersweet, tender narrative that had me gripped from the first chapter. We need more books like this. And while it's a YA novel, the writing and the narrative felt far more mature in style and content, sophisticated in a way. Lily's courage is admirable, and her pain is palpable. Beautifully written and immersive.  pls read this. especially if you’re a lesbian. that’s all. My favorite book by the author so far. Great historical fiction  4.5/5 book was cute ending was mid “haven’t you ever wondered what it would be like to have nothing keeping you attached to the ground?”there is only one word i can use to describe this book, and that is: tender. it’s tender and soft and moves gently through the scenes like waves in water. throughout its conflict, the character’s development, and the growth of the love story, there was just tenderness.a lot of historical fiction about queer people tells the story of persecution &amp; pain &amp; shame but malinda lo did something so unique, so inspiring with ‘last night at the telegraph club’. she envisioned a reality - a history, a moment in time - with all the boundaries &amp; limitations that 1950’s san francisco contained and yet painted it with hope.‘last night at the telegraph club’ is the story of chinese-american lily hu trying to understand herself when the language to define who she is was as foreign as her parents’ mother tongue in the land lily calls home. set during the red scare - fear of the potential rise of communism - that persecuted chinese immigrants, the novel is rife with the fear of lily’s life being snatched from her very fingers. but then she starts to learn about another community, one so close &amp; yet so far from the one she was raised in, and lily begins to realize that her queer- and racial-identity paint an even bigger target on her back.but ‘last night at the telegraph club’ is not just a story of a society of fear, it is also a love story. lily, against all the odds, manages to find someone who sees the very truth of her and loves it. loves her. and despite the time period, lily does not feel shame but pure exhilaration that only your first love can provide.i think the hype surrounding this book may leave some readers disappointed when they finally read it because they may be expecting big moments and big drama but the hype for this book is in the moments between all the Big Scenes; it’s in lily’s strength and courage, it’s in the random pieces of dialogue that speak to a larger community, to a sense of comfort; and it’s in the gentle way it delivers the most harrowing of moments.  dnf - came for the lesbians, stopped reading for the YA style writing  eye-opening read that explored the emotions and struggles of a queer girl whilst juggling the expectations of a good Chinese American daughter in the 1950s. what made this book even more interesting is how the author weaved elements of history and politics (the Red Scare, McCarthyism, etc.) into the plot-line, beefing up the intensity, risks and seriousness associated with the main character’s journey coming to terms with her sexuality  This book was so emotional that it made me sick to my stomach. 5 stars. This book follows Lily Hu as she grapples with what it means to grow up as a Chinese American who is questioning her sexuality. Having felt as though she had her sexuality figured out, Kathleen Miller shouldn't give her butterflies in her stomach. However, as her feelings for Kath grow stronger, she learns what it is like to fall in love differently than how it has been envisioned for her. This book is hard-hitting and especially emotional for those who can relate to the story. This book gave me insight into what it meant to be a Chinese American who is figuring themselves out and probably growing up differently that what is expected in a time where the threat of deportation threatens those closest to them. It reminded me of just how dangerous it can be for others who are not as privileged as me to come out. Being a lesbian and reading Last Night at the Telegraph Club, I saw myself represented here and I am especially grateful for that. I honestly think that everyone should read this book at least once to experience the kind of love that Lily and Kath have found in each other.   3.5 Why can't lesbians just be happy? my heart was so happy experiencing falling in love like I did together with the characters in this book and especially since I’ve wanted to read more wlw books because it’s so different reading when you actually are represented &lt;3. however, it was slow and boring at times and the ending was a little rushed.   Empathy, euphoria... heart-wrenchingly beautiful. I don't know if I can find the words right now. This is why I love reading. This is why I aspire to publish a book one day. Books like these. Not only have I felt seen as a reader, but I feel seen as a queer person. There are some things, some feelings that can't be put into words, but somehow Malinda Lo put them into words in this book. The feeling of finding bits of pieces of yourself that add up to the realization that you're gay, the fear of people finding out, and when that fear turns into anger and resistance. Lily is such an amazingly written character. Looking at her from the beginning of the book and the end is so drastically and beautifully different, her character development is perfection. 5 stars. Easily 5 stars.  Sometimes those books you read with all the award stickers on them get it wrong. This one got it right. O que dizer sobre este livro? Bom, é um livro incrível. Já estava à espera de uma leitura impactante, que fosse deixar-me agarrada ao livro desde a primeira página. Mas mesmo assim o livro conseguiu surpreender-me e ir além das expectativas. É uma história que conseguiu um lugar especial no meu coração.⁣⁣⁣⁣É uma história comovente. É impossível não ficar com o coração apertadinho ao ler a história de Lily e Kath. Assim como é impossível não ficar-se apaixonado por estas duas personagens. A Lily então, foi uma personagem que adorei conhecer. Acho que nunca quis tanto que um casal literário ficasse junto. Toda a atmosfera de descobrir o primeiro amor, a intensidade do amor entre ambas… é simplesmente incrível. E depois, toda a história passar-se numa época tão complicada e cheia de restrições e preconceitos.⁣⁣⁣⁣Adorei a forma como a autora transmitiu para o leitor a história em contexto com tudo o que estava a acontecer no mundo, com algumas timelines, por exemplo. Gostei mesmo da forma como toda a história, bem como a realidade daquela altura, foi explicada no livro. De forma simples, a Malinda Lo conseguiu transmitir ao leitor a realidade daquela altura.⁣⁣⁣⁣Recomendo este livro, sem dúvida que foi um livro marcante para mim. É daqueles livros que se lê e depois de ler ficámos a pensar nele durante imenso tempo. Um livro inesquecível.⁣⁣  Plot:Set in 1950s San Francisco, this book follows 17-year old Lily Hu. Lily lives in Chinatown with her parents and younger brothers. While dealing with her senior year of school, the threats of Communism and deportation, Lily befriends Kathleen 'Kath' Miller. Together they start meeting in secret to go to a Lesbian bar, called the Telegraph Club to watch 'a male impersonator' perform. The pair develop a close, secret friendship which blossoms into something more.Thoughts:Five Things I loved about this book:1. The Premise: This book was so intriguing from the first time I heard the basic idea. Historical fiction with same-sex relationships AND interracial relationships are not something I've come across before. The book tells a modern story, in an un-modern time. I love that the writer didn't use racism as a major plot point, there is some references to the historical context, but the fact the two girls are different races is not mentioned.2. Lily and Kath: The two girls are just so cute! They share an interest in Maths. Lily wants to work on spaceships, and Kath wants to be a pilot. While Lily's friends dismiss her dreams, Kath is so supportive of them, and vice versa. The romance is slightly slow-burn and it takes awhile for the two to come together, but they are so cute in lead-up and once they get together. Their relationship evolves naturally as they share this secret about the club, and their true selves.3. The writing style: The writer included flashbacks to Lily's parents in America at the end of each section. It also included a timeline, with important family events, and important historical events to give context to the family history. I loved this little glimpses, I did expect them to lead to some big revelation, but they were fun to read.4. Baby Sapphics meet Older Sapphics: Lily and Kath befriends some slightly older Lesbians while attending the Telegraph Club. I loved this inclusion, as it showed the girls they weren't alone in the world, and there was hope. Lily is very shy when she starts attending the club, and she starts to open up and learn more about this world from the other women at the club.5. The Setting: Chinatown in 1950s San Francisco provides such an interesting backdrop for this story. In the post-war years, and with China dealing with communism, there is fear around. It is not a time period or setting I had previously read, and it was so intriguing. The girls practice for an air raid attack, in between planning dances and dealing with boys.Representation:BIPOC: - Lily (MC), most of her friends and family are Chinese-American living in Chinatown. They are shown eating traditional food, celebrating Chinese New Year and speaking Cantonese. - Kath (Love Interest) is Italian-American.LGBT:- This book is a female-female romance, between Lily and Kath. Both identify as homosexual and liking girls, although there is no explicit 'Lesbian' labelling, neither display any interest in boys. They attend the Telegraph Club were they meet other Lesbians, who are both Butch and Femme.OWN VOICES:- Malinda Lo identifies as Asian-American and a Lesbian, so both representations can be classified as own voices rep.  ¿Qué puedo decir? Pues que este librito fue la primera tentación (de miles) a la que una de mis amiwis de bookstagram me hizo sucumbir. Sí es cierto que ya había oído hablar antes de este libro, pero después de que ella lo recomendara SUPE que debía leerlo🤭 I mean, la premisa es una maravilla: 1950, San Francisco, Chinatown, en medio de la Guerra Fría; una época especialmente difícil para los ciudadanos americanos de origen chino y, por supuesto, el tema central de la historia: las personas LGBT+. Entre estas páginas conoceremos a Lily, nuestra protagonista, una joven que descubrirá la existencia de un pub lésbico, ‘The Telegraph Club’, y todo en lo que sentía cobrará más sentido que nunca.La verdad, creo que no lo leí en el mejor momento, ya que iba encontrando hueco entre viaje y viaje; no obstante, sí lo disfruté.La ambientación me pareció espectacular en todos los sentidos y Lily se convirtió de inmediato en mi personaje favorito. Fue genial ver cómo poco a poco iba evolucionando, a pesar de todos los problemas que surgían a su alrededor; en especial, con su familia. Creo que también lidia muy bien con el tema de las amistades tóxicas y, sobre todo, con el del primer amor dentro de una sociedad que te desprecia por lo que eres✨Aunque algo lenta, es una historia que consigue sumergirte por completo y contener el aliento; aparte de que es imposible no conectar con los personajes y su historia. Me hubiera gustado, quizás, que profundizase más en algunos de los secundarios y tramas, de las que hay pinceladas, pero no se exploran al 100 %. Pero, aun así, yo la recomiendo muchísimo. ¡Tendríais que habernos visto a Daphne y a mí fangirlear en nuestra Lectura Conjunta😌!  the closest to my fave, The Miseducation of Cameron Post, out of all of them, prose is good, emotionally honest, bittersweet. I picked the book,  Last Night at the Telegraph Club, because of the book cover and because 2022 is the year I wanted to read more diversely and own voice. Last Night at the Telegraph Club checks these two prompts because the author,  Malinda Lo, is Asian-American and part of the LGBTQ+ community.I like function books that teach me new things, and this book does it very interestingly. I knew that San Fransisco was the capital of the LGBTQ+ community.  Last Night at the Telegraph Club is a historical fiction taking place post-WWII, but it has flashbacks before and during the war. While reading the book, I learned about the Chinese-American community in San Fransisco and how the relations were after the war between the American government and the community because of the Communist revolution in China.The book also teaches how the sapphic community lived during the day and how they spent their time at night at special clubs and private parties. Who told people that you couldn't learn something new through YA historical fiction? It is a beautiful way to teach young readers about the diverse history that educational history books don't teach.The story's premise is Lily's discovery and acceptance of her sexuality and captures the fears, confusion, and excitement that accompany a first love, kiss, and heartbreak. Lily is a character with many viewpoints, and I like that the author wrote about her as an academic interested in mathematics and fascination with space.I would suggest listening to the audiobook, as there are Mandarin &amp; Cantonese phrases in the book that will be hard to read for non-Chinese readers (even though it has translation).We need more like  Last Night at the Telegraph Club; I look forward to reading more books by  Malinda Lo.  5 | 5 ⭐️ kazdy powinien poznac ta historie fr! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This made me really miss you.  AMAZING representation all around with this book, absolutely loved and i loved that it wasnt a “everything’s perfect!!” book &lt;3 wonderful. - lesbian pulp! ❤️ - the bar (broadly speaking but also this one in particular) as site of community in which bb!lesbians are lovingly enfolded into the world of women who love women (I enjoyed lo's historical note in its entirety; among what I appreciated it was that lo emphasized that she used terms, whether for race or gender, that were most widely in use at the time--a few of the secondary and tertiary characters would likely not consider themselves cis women today, because shit is nebulous like that!). - other characters are more central to this story, but there are things that will stay with me about the alluring tommy andrews, both symbol and very real human being, she of the cologne whose "scent was heavy, like being drunk on a leather sofa. it made lily's skin go warm" and who "said she thought of herself as the long-lost andrews sister."- a resolution that manages to feel both brave and happy without feeling like wishful-thinking retcon of the time period--"her mother's face swam into focus, her brown eyes full of the sharp worry of love, and lily thought, you will never look at me like this again".I initially read the blurb for this back before its release and was like whoa, how is lo going to juggle all of this?? but she does, and everything has adequate time to breathe. just a joyous and loving and very wonderfully historically rooted book. the like oooonnnnnneeee tiny little thing that felt "missing" for me was like, maybe an acknowledgment that communism...is not inherently evil, lol? but also, again, lo was writing from a very "I will make this true to the values and mores of the time period" place, and I think it makes sense for this character in this family in this place and time to not have like, this leftist or anti-assimilationist revelation.nuanced and lovely. lily experiences racism and homophobia from people within and outside of various communities to which she belongs, but it's neither tragedy porn nor some trite inspirational "everything will turn out fine and you can do it!" situation. it's just her life, which is full of so many different layered experiences, some of which are painful and some of which are overflowing with joy.not a perfect book--I always want to drop that in there when my 5-star rating might mislead people or overhype something for them--but one that I wholeheartedly enjoyed steadily poring over. huntress hit me where I lived in my late teenage years, and I'm glad to see that lo can still deliver something this great.(also, I tend to avoid audiobooks read by emily woo zeller because I HATED her narration of ninefox gambit and felt meh about it in under a painted sky, but I didn't drop this once I realized she was narrating because I had been on hold with the library for so long, lol, and I'm glad I didn't! I actually thought she did a really solid job of narrating here--could also just be that I liked this book and its writing better than those other two.)  This is my favorite book of 2022 so far. Beautiful lqbtq coming of age story/ historical fiction set in one of my favorite cities. I didn’t know very much about this time period and I am inspired to read and learn more.  I wish I could give this book 10 stars.  Overall it was fun, but I didn't find the first half captivating enough and when things started to happen, it seemed a bit rushed😕 I already know this book will be a 2022 favorite. I’m not usually one for historical fiction, but this book swept me off my feet and brought me into a vivid 1954 Chinatown where I met Lily and Kath. The book explores identity and loving who you are.  Absolutely beautiful. So my students picked this as their latest book club read. They were excited about it but ultimately were left feeling a little disappointed. I was heading for a solid 4 stars on this until a rather rushed ending that left too many things unresolved. After talking to my students I was left with an even greater sense of the book lacking a focused plot (it tried to cover a few different things and as such it left some hanging at the end). We also couldn't figure out the point of the flashbacks and it felt like the author was trying to achieve too much in one book.However, there are not enough books where the main protagonist(s) are young lesbians who are trying to figure out their sexuality. Even less so, characters who are non white and struggling with their sexuality against traditional families and cultures.A solid read that had potential to be better.  Este libro me encantó mucho, muy bien manejados los temas que toca, y los personajes tanto principales como secundarios los sentí muy reales. Definitvamente leeré el libro de este año de la autora. I feel so empty  Definitely not a bad book, but I don’t think it was paced very well. The beginning and middle of the book dragged on, pretty much nothing happened and while I’m here for all vibes no plot books (or parts of books) most of the time - here it lacked a bit of the club vibes for me. I wish that was explored a lot more than it was, especially since the club is the title of the book. Then the last part of the book where we finally get to consequences of the whole book happening it was soooo fast paced that I couldn’t keep up with it. It felt very rushed.Additionally, I don’t think I fell in love with the main characters love, you know?It was an okay book   3/5“She’s having a hard time right now because you’re not what she expected. But we’re never what our parents expected. They have to learn that lesson.”Historia Lily jest niesamowicie autentyczna i prawdziwa. Bliskie mogą okazać się nam poruszany w książce temat poznania siebie i zaakceptowania tego. Sprawiło to, że podczas czytania poczułam się zrozumiana. Książka ta porusza ogrom bardzo ważnych tematów. Fakt, że okoliczności oparte są na prawdziwych zdarzeniach z przeszłości czyni ją jeszcze bardziej ważną.Osobiście mimo wszystko książka ta nie jest do końca dla mnie. Nie była to zła lektura ale też mnie nie zachwyciła. Myślę jednak, że dla wielu osób książka ta może być bardzo bliska.  Asian queer YA! The premise of this books is fantastic - Asian diasporic experience crashing up against queer identity struggle, set amid the Red Scare in fifties San Francisco - this book is well done, although I almost feel like this requires a precursor lecture for pre-teens and teens, so that there is understanding of what the Red Scare was, the illegality of homosexuality etc.  a little slow-paced but so atmospheric and heartfelt “Last night at the telegraph club” was the first romance I’ve ever read but I don’t think that’s the reason why I’m giving it a 4.5 stars rating. This book was surprising on so many levels. I didn’t expect it to talk about so many completely different topics such as racism, homophobia, immigration, Chinese American culture, gender expression, lesbian culture, oppression, politics, etc; to give us such detailed and well thought out backstories as well as great development for so many characters, and to bring me as much excitement and curiosity as it did melancholy and shock. All of that within 400 pages and written with the perfect pace. I didn’t care much about the main character at first but Lily Hu is actually one of the most complex characters I’ve encountered in a while. The author gave us a student, a daughter, a friend, a sister, a niece, a teenager, a first generation of an immigrant family, and a lover. Other characters like Kath, Judy and Lana were in my opinion equally unforgettable. From my personal experience with entertainment content, it’s hard to find well written female characters and Malinda Lo did just that. Something that left me speechless and that I find admirable is the amount of research that it took to write this story about love in a conservative society and a post-war environment. The attention and care the author had when it came to being historically accurate, both language and behaviour wise is remarkable. Every single word in this book felt real and had a purpose and that’s probably one of the things that I appreciate the most about it. I also love its cyclicity. There’s something so unsettling but so interesting and special about all the parallels and symbolism in this romance. The last few chapters felt immensely overwhelming and angsty in the best way possible. At times I wished the vocabulary wasn’t so plain and common but it’s incredibly well written nonetheless. I don’t think there’s a need for a sequel however there were certain parts of the story that felt kind of unfinished - wasted potential to an extent. I don’t mean that Malinda Lo didn’t make the most out of these beautiful 400 pages, I just think there should have been a few extra pages. The book is excellent from the beginning till the end and I can’t recommend it enough.  I love it. I love the historical details that the author adds. I love the sexuality discovery journey of Lily. The historical aspect is interesting but it can't seem to connect with the main plot in my opinion. The one thing I dislike most about this book is Kath being a character. She is pretty plain and has no personality whatsoever. I feel like she has fallen into pixie manic dream girl trope. I hope the author has extended more to see what happened after the event at the end of the book.  If we saw Kath's letters to Lily I think we could understand Kath's character more and not her being a character device for Lily    Whoa! If I didn't know better, I'd think that author Malinda Lo lived in San Francisco during the time period this historical novel spans, mostly 1954. She captures the paranoia of the Red Scare, xenophobia, and pressure from peers and parents perfectly while also somehow choosing just the right words to tell this story of first love. It's a gentle story yet one that is fully aware of the societal dangers in two girls falling in love. Today's readers may not realize that at that time there were often police raids of bars that catered to gay/lesbian clientele. Seventeen-year-old Lily Hu dreams of a career in mathematics or something associated with rocketry, and she's always been a dutifully obedient daughter living in Chinatown. Her best friend Shirley is confident, more than a little bossy, and Lily wonders about the changes she sees in her friend as Shirley begins spending time with an older boy. Lily herself has had unexplainable feelings about seeing women in beauty pageants and a book she found in the drugstore featuring two women in a romantic relationship. And she's fascinated by Tommy Andrews, a male impersonator. When she realizes that she has some things in common with Kathleen Miller, a classmate that she's barely noticed in the past but who enjoys math and dreams of flying, Lily's feelings grow even more confused. The girls slip out of their houses to spend time at the Telegraph Club, a popular lesbian watering hole where Tommy Andrews performs. These meetings are secret until someone sees Lily outside the bar during a raid. Lily must decide whether to tell the truth about her feelings to her family or deny an important part of herself. The author carefully describes Lily's confusion, uncertainty, and halting steps as she begins her first romantic relationship and explores her own sexual desire as well as claiming her identity and place in the world. Her story is fascinating and engaging on its own merit, but when set against its historical context and interwoven with snippets of stories from other family members, it takes on even more importance. I won't be the only reader to fall in love with Lily or to wonder where this book has been all of my life.  I've enjoyed most of Lo's prior works, and am glad I picked up her latest. It is a departure from what I usually read (historical fiction tends to either swing too idealistic/unrealistic OR it is depressing as hell) and Lo found a way to give me a happy ending while transporting me vividly into San Fransisco, USA in the 1950s (shudder). This book was extraordinarily well researched (you can check the 9 page Author's Note and 2 page Bibliography if you don't believe me) and it both shone through in the book's delivery and made the book very enjoyable to read. It was Sarah Waters-y in that way, almost too much detail on things I don't usually care about (e.g. skirts, stockings, etc.). That said, it also did a great job of acknowledging the political climate in that time and how it tainted the lives of both queer white people and all Chinese/Chinese Americans.Speaking of queer white people, I adored the romance of this book (love me a friends-to-lovers slow burn). And I loved that Kath noticed Lily first, and for a while, but never pushed, and admitted she liked her because of how she bit her lip when solving math problems, especially given the context of how racist many white people in the book were about Lily's appearance.If I had to get nit-picky about why I don't think this is 5 stars, I'd say there were two things going on:1. The book felt a little bit like a familiar, well-trodden path. The manipulative best friend. The beauty pageant. The unsupportive parents. The 1/3rd 1/3rd 1/3rd formulaic nature of the book's plot (it was literally page 130, page 262 when the "big plot points" happened). Aside from the well-researched, likely previously unwritten POV on this time period, there was a lot here that felt unoriginal.2. There were some stylistic decisions that I didn't think added anything to the book. For example, the timelines before each subsection were just confusing to me. Also, I don't think the chapters written from Lily's mom/dad/aunt's perspectives really did anything to enhance the book and probably could have been scrapped. Again, maybe some people loved this, but to me it was very shrug.  I liked how the main character was multi-faceted and how the book looked at intersectionality. That being said I wish the ending was more conclusive, even though I realize that the ending was probably more realistic. Para mim o livro foi 4.5 estrelas, mas entre das 4 ou 5 estrelas para um livro sáfico, com representantividade asiática, eu prefiro dar 5.A /única/ coisa que me desagradou nesse livro foi o final, que pareceu um pouco corrido e não tivemos algumas "respostas", mas só isso mesmo.Para quem está procurando por um romance lésbico com um leve tom político e que também fala bastante sobre preconceito racial com pessoas amarelas, e que não fique martelando na questão de heterossexualidade compulsória, esse livro é para você.Gostaria só de falar que tem SIM gatilhos, sendo o maior deles a homofobia, tanto vinda da família da personagem principal, quanto de outros personagens.Fora isso, eu AMEI a leitura, foi super fluída e eu consegui me idendificar em vários momentos com o que a Lily estava pensando. Achei o romance super natural e gostoso de se ler, e isso me prendeu demais.Uma delicinha de livro. Leria de novo fácil.  Malinda Lo’s writing has improved a lot since her earlier works. This book brings 1950s San Francisco to life on the page, from the busy streets of Chinatown to the smoky nightclubs near the border of the neighbourhood. This book doesn’t have much in terms of plot. It follows the daily life of 17-year-old Lily Hu, a Chinese-American girl as she goes to high school and interacts with her family and friends. By all accounts this book should be boring, but I wasn’t bored. I liked Lily’s ambition to pursue a math and science career, which was unusual for most girls in her time period, and I liked her strong sense of loyalty to the people she cared about. I also liked her love interest Kath Miller, who shares her academic interests and who introduces Lily to the Telegraph Club.I appreciate that Lo wrote an actual lesbian character who behaves like a lesbian. There is no pathetic forced heterosexual kissing or dating and no attempt to cover up for her lesbianism by getting a boyfriend. Lily is so repulsed by the idea of going on a date with a boy that she ends up ruining her friendship with the male friend who asks her out. Lily likes only girls and it shows in her thoughts and behaviour. It’s a shame that real lesbian characters are so rare in contemporary and historical teen fiction.The flashback interludes with Lily’s parents and aunt were unnecessary, as they added very little to the story and the sense of time and place were already firmly established in Lily’s perspective. I would rather that Lo had thrown out those pages and traded them for more interactions between Lily and Kath, especially after their separation, since there is only one interaction between them after that point. The Cantonese phrases were also pointless—the majority of people who read this book don’t know Cantonese and the words written in Chinese characters will mean nothing to them. At the least the author could have transliterated those parts so the reader would have an idea of how to pronounce them.  This book was so good - really an interesting intersection about LGBTQ life and being the daughter of immigrants from China in the 1950s. Lily is this character who seems trapped between two worlds, trying to find herself. The story was really enthralling and I really enjoyed it. This book was so cathartic and such a very good read, very different than my normal read, I definitely enjoyed it thoroughly! Definitely on the top of my lgbtqia+ reads!  
  Perhaps that was the most perverse part of this: the inside-outness of everything, as if denial would make it go away, when it only made the pain in her chest tighten, when it only made her emotions clearer.
You think your life is hard? Try to be a Chinese-American lesbian teenager in the mid-’50sThis is my first book in the year and I’m so glad I started with this one, despite strong conflicts between both of the main character and the environment she’s in (we’re situated in the 50´decade post-war, where we can see raised dust) I enjoyed it a lot, Is not a slow book and goes directly to the point, action after action we see how the protagonist grows at the end to her true essence, which leads her to explore situations she never thought before could make and we’re part of this discovering and personal growth, we understand her perfectly fine, why does she act like that and what conditions made her to resolute as she did. A valuable aspect in this book was all the context we were embedded into, it sounds so bad to tell, but there’s a wrong perception where the fact that are certain people from China or has Chinese ancestry they're all the same or identical, here this is discussed also, there are tangible differences in that population such as the language or cultural expressions, in contrast of what is commonly perceived. To learn a little bit more about the world and how it’s organized in different parts of the planet is priceless and the way the author had presented all these aspects made all these concepts easily understandable for every lector, and don´t get me started with the nocturne world in San Francisco and its nightclubs, great work in researching and data collection, you can feel the vibes at the moment whatever it is the location in which the events in the book are happening.Lily was a wonderful main character, I loved her and that’s it, an essential characteristic of her personality that deserves to be outstanding is her insight and how analytic she can be with the people who surround her and what they say or do, she has a mind that is always working and open its way across the world, she´s in a place in her life in which she has the NEED to explorer life and herself, she’s not perfect, and that makes her character deeper with a big impact, if it’s not known yet at this point she is an American citizen with Chinese ancestry, her family is conservative and given the period of time characterized by stigmatization to different groups of people it was a big issue, but she never gave up and didn´t let that her family members’ and friends’ opinions trample her true self and repressed the authentic Lily, that obstinacy she had, led her ‘til unsuspected limits, great that it was like that, it was wonderful to witness this growth. Lily has a very interesting feature which the majority of queer people when teens can relate, insecurity, she was afraid to say or do anything for more innocent it was, to have this feeling of shame on situations that are perfectly fine to feel or things that you haven’t done yet, it’s a sensation in which a lot of us were I think, Lily is a unique authentic character.
  her feelings seemed to swell inside her so painfully that she was terrified she might burst. Was this what it felt like to love someone?
Lily’s love interest is Kath, she was a good support character, she helped in many different ways to Lily, in things that she wanted to try or how she wanted to develop herself into this new panorama uncertain until now to her, the best of their relationship is that she never pushed to Lily even when she could do it but it gave her freedom in what she was comfortable or not, what was she prepared to explore or not, Kath had a clear goal in life and it was cool, If there’s something in this character that I did not like is her lack of hues, I felt as if always she was in a straight line and had no variations in her, a deeper introspection into her would have made me love her more than I actually did.
  Haven’t you ever wondered what it would be like to have nothing keeping you attached to the ground?
🛩️Let’s talk about miss Shirley Lum, I liked this character so much and I enjoyed to a large degree, now, I know she’s a girl full of prejudices until her top and even more in the context we are, she was cruel to Lily several times and above all, she wanted to influence Lily and made her act in the way she considered was right or get benefited herself in some way, the thing is I love everything Shirley’s character represents but no What she said or did and that’s exactly what added flavor to the story, gave us all dramatic and touching moments, where we believed Lily was going to give up everything and succumb under all this pressure but she didn’t, Shirley’s presence determinate in a great amount Lily’s growth as an individual, the story would not be complete without her, she’s kinda an antagonist.
  Lily had admired the way Shirley sailed through the world with such confidence, as if she wore an impenetrable armor that protected her against all slights, real or imagined.
In the story we know lesbian women that makes visible this world that is certainly unknown for me, I love the everyday life in which every one of them interacts, we had Tommy Andrews, Paula, Claire, they add her own personality and essence to the plot and enriches the story, but my favorite is Lana Jackson, she's awesomeThere are some memorable scenes in the book, I think that all the content in the book has a very comfy atmosphere, full of satisfying moments and of realization for the main character, but most of them are in the last parts of the book, When Shirley and Lily confronted each other they lit up a fire, and If that’s no enough just a little later Lily confronted her mother Grace Hu telling her true, there’s no more space or time for lying, it’s a hard passage when Grace rejects her y tries to convince Lily That this is a mistake, she’s not like that, it’s just a phase she’s going through and all that kind of shit we always hear to the tiredness, she told her she could be forgiven (as If she did something wrong) If she realizes that she did a mistake, and Lily in a hit of resolution decide to not lying and to not live unhappily in order to please her family and friends without thinking in what she really wants, this girl was on fire.My favorite scene: Lily, Claire, and Lana in the apartment of the latter after Lily run away from her home, talking, drinking, sharing their personal experiences, it was a simple scene but so intimate that it felt real, very well executed and clearly you could feel the vibes you feel when you’re with your friends been just yourselves.I couldn´t let without mentioning this part where Eddie tells Lily that people at school y talking about her, that he still loved her, and If it was necessary he could punch the kids who were talking about her, it was so touching to see that the person who gives Lily more support in her family was his younger brother, such a necessary scene.The book is great, well representation of Chinese-American people, and lesbian women, also the historical context in San Francisco and the nights in these clubs made totally worth this reading.👩🏽‍🚀🎩  U can accomblish wonderful things at workokay umm wow heart fucking wrenching review laterReview:Okay 5 stars is pretty rare from me so let me break it down for yall1. The writing was *chef's kiss*. I got swept from my feet into the world of our protagonist Lily. It was sooo refreshing to read a lgbtq+ novel that wasnt about two caucasian middle class ppl. Through Lily being chinese american we also saw how in the gay community there was (and still is) racial indifferences and casual racism. It brought light upon the fact that white ppl are still on the safer grounds even though belonging to a minority group.2. Gave very good information of the struggles of being gay. Even though we have so much more rights than they had back the in the 50s, it still felt sickening to aknowledge ive felt the same fears as Lily.3. Our bestie Malinda Lo did her research on the language that was used in the 50s and also on the events that occured.4. Even tho this book tackeled some difficult topics I felt comforted by it too. Most of the time I was excited for Lily and I felt like her life was filled with so many warm elements. That being said i also felt her fear very clearly. The emotions that were being expressed either by her or by the environment were so well passed on to the reader that i got visibly umcomfortable at some situations. Yes yes thats what a book is supposed to do - but damn do some books just miss the obvious mark and fail to deliver.Finally i gotta applaud once again for the writing. Havent in a while been so well cared for by an author. I felt like I had built the whole world into my mind and had zero struggles understanding our protagonists surroundings. I had so detailed pictures of every place that Lily visited that I got taken back at some point by it.  Aqui está uma entrada direta para o top dos romances favoritos. Eu adorei, a-do-rei, a história de “Last Night at the Telegraph Club”, do primeiro ao último parágrafo. Sem dúvida, encontrei o meu casal sáfico favorito até ao momento – isto não é spoiler, não sejam Joana’s e leiam as sinopses.O enredo gira em torno de duas jovens, no início da década de 50, que se apercebem ter algo em comum, sentem-se atraídas por mulheres, isto numa época em que ser gay era crime. (Sim, foi há pouco tempo e não, infelizmente a sociedade não evoluiu assim tanto e já está em regressão.) Adiante. Lily e Kath também têm o comum o facto de ambicionarem com profissões onde as mulheres praticamente não existiam (e onde ainda hoje são uma minoria…) e sonham com um futuro bem diferente do conservadorismo do seu tempo. Com isto, as jovens começam uma amizade muito bonita, que se vai desenvolvendo e tem como pano de funfo o Telegraph Club, um clube noturno que é uma atração turística e, simultaneamente, um ponto de encontro de mulheres gay. Não falta nada a este romance Malinda Lo. As temáticas principais são evidentes – questões sociais e de género –, no entanto o livro mais além e mergulha-nos em Chinatown e nas dinâmicas de uma comunidade chinesa que sofre devido a pressões políticas e xenófobas. A amizade e a coragem destas jovens são inspiradoras e eu fiquei maravilhada com jornada de autoconhecimento das personagens, com o desenvolvimento da relação entre ambas, bem como com os restantes intervenientes secundário. Além do romance, posso dizer-vos que a autora faz contextualização histórica da narrativa, subtil e bem fundamentada, da linguagem aos acontecimentos da década que se interlaçam perfeitamente na ficção. Enfim, eu não quero criar-vos expectativas, mas não tenho absolutamente nada de negativo a apontar a este livro. Um cinco estrelas absoluto.   DNFed at 50%.As a history teacher, I liked the immersive way Malinda Lo implemented the Red Scare history with Lily’s story, the imagery and easy writing also pretty good. But as a reader, this book fell completely flat. I didn’t really care much about anybody to be honest; I just appreciated the discussions and other POVs about life as a Chinese American/or immigrant during the Cold War and Red Scare of the 1950s, since Chinese Americans and Chinese immigrants were suspected of being communists because of China’s new government. Pretty thorough research to make a vivid story accessible to young readers, but it becomes useless when trying to make a story that’s not really going anywhere—I honestly doubt Lily’s dad will be deported, and her and Kath will be together and happy forever blah blah blah (the stakes are just non-existent, that’s the problem).Sorry to those who loved this book, but I just can’t waste more time with this boring story.  What I love about this book is that it provides historical context within the story itself: I happen to know a little bit about worldwide politics during and after World War II, and while my insights are focused on communities closer to me geographically, this book provides insight on what it was like for Chinatown in San Francisco, the oldest community outthere, which got stuck between two forces of USA and China.Basically characters are walking the line between allegiances. AND since we are in the 1950s, we are facing various issues concerning LGBTQA+ community: there is public prejudice against same-sex relationships, first the allowance of public gatherings and then there are police raids. AND there is this witch hunt which allows one person to work for the government despite being a former Nazi and the other end up in jail, cause of their heritage.These facts are stated in the timeline, so by the time the story progresses, we know what's at stake. And so far the romance is so nice and easy-going, the feeling of dread, of what's gonna happen next, isn't exactly overwhelming. So far.And it feels organic, that one of the characters is a space nerd: I remember my grandma telling stories how many of her peers were obsessed with the idea of going to space. Like, it's something we are used to now and it's so new to them.There was lack of the resources, no internet to search for friends or information, you have to go to a certain fairly forbidden location - Broadway of San Francisco is famous for night clubs with bad reputation - and make small talk. Like, this book is a gem, folks!  the premise sounded real promising (1950’s chinatown with a sapphic asian mc), but i was a bit underwhelmed. the book didn’t really get interesting until about halfway through. i really felt for lily, though, and think she was a lovable main character. her journey of self-discovery and stepping outside of the norms she has known her whole life is one that many girls and women can relate to. she’s just really wholesome and the story of her first love had me rooting for her happiness. her chinese heritage is written really well so it feels rich and authentic. her conservative family values are something i have experienced firsthand, so i understood all the emotions she went through. actually, i could kind of see myself in her in general.i think that the lesbian bar community is somewhat obscure in terms of lgbtq+ history, at least to me. it was interesting to learn about this environment through the eyes of lily and the acquaintances she makes. some of them limited her to her asian identity and treated her like some exotic doll. well, it is historically accurate for white people to do that (not that some of them don’t do that now) but i digress. overall this isn’t a bad book, i just came into it expecting more. perhaps it’s because it’s ya as opposed to just regular adult, since i feel like there is a certain depth missing from the plot if that makes sense. i give it a solid 3.5 stars extra note: i find it cute how lily is interested in the workings of aerodynamics while kath wants to be a pilot :) also i detest shirley i wish the worst for her she was such a snake!  1954, Chinatown, San Francisco. Lily Hu is a high school senior. She’s a hard worker and wants to go to Cal, and eventually work at JPL on rockets, like her aunt. She senses she may be different from her best friend Shirley, but she may also be chafing against her family’s restrictions. But then a few things open her eyes: a flier from the Telegraph Club for a female performer who dresses like a man, a sapphic penny novel in a drug store, and her classmate Kathleen Miller. When Kath mentions that she’s been to the Telegraph Club, Lily is intrigued and scared, but she decides it’s worth the risk to find out who she is. Against the backdrop of McCarthyism and the Red Scare, but anti-Chinese sentiment, though, Lily has to once again balance her family’s wishes against her own identity. I could just point you in the direction of @whatellaread review, because she says exactly what I’d like to say about this book. This was our book club pick for the month of March, and unfortunately Ella and I were the only ones available for the discussion, but that meant we took a deep dive into the state of realistic YA fiction. We both felt that Lo captures the first crush feeling perfectly. It’s all the more heightened in the setting of 1950s, with queer culture being particularly taboo, and even more so for a marginalized character like Lily. Cultural and familial expectations weigh heavily on Lily, and yet, like in all coming of age novels, she needs to make a choice for herself. Richly researched and deeply personal, this is queer YA historical fiction, that I think many readers of all ages will connect with.   my short review: let’s go lesbians, let’s go.longer review: i am so happy this book exists. and i am so upset that i did not have this when i was younger, obsessed with historical fiction, and just beginning to discover queer media. it took me so long to read a book that wasn’t about cis, white mlm. i don’t want to go back through my goodreads profile to confirm it, but i think i didn’t even read my first f/f book until i was fourteen.i do tend to have a problem, when i’m giving goodreads reviews, where i’ll just give almost everything 5 stars. this book is no exception—there were definitely some parts that were a bit slower, where my interest wavered, but any of that was completely overshadowed by the moments i loved. malinda lo captures the feeling of first love so incredibly well. (i mean, i can’t really speak from personal experience because i am aroace, but this book feels the same way as all the other books i’ve read where the reviews say they accurately portray teenagers in love.)lily is such a wonderful character. i love her, and all i want is to travel back in time and into this fictional world to tell her that it gets better. her relationship with her childhood best friend shirley feels oddly familiar to me, even though i’ve never really had a friendship like that at all. i love her aunt judy—she’s not perfect, but she’s kind and tries to understand. and, of course, i love kath. the way she and lily fall in love so gradually and then so quickly is peak lesbian culture. in conclusion: women. that is all.  I love this book so, so dearly. I am usually picky with couples but Lily and Kath were just [sighs dreamily]. Last Night at the Telegraph Club was the epitome of Sapphic Pining and a nuanced exploration of lesbian subculture. It's tender, bittersweet, and downright heartbreaking sometimes. And I'll be the first to admit that it's not a flawless book. It ended abruptly and many of the side arcs were left hanging. But I understand why Malinda Lo did the latter. In 1950s San Francisco, immigrants were forced to be compliant should they be threatened by deportation and the LGBT community sought refuge in gay bars. I believe that's what Malinda was trying to echo in her writing. Who knows how many minorities in the past weren't given a platform to speak. Their stories fallen between the cracks, waiting to be found after decades. It's hard enough for Lily to come out as a lesbian during the Red Scare, her being Chinese-American complicated matters. I know many (white) readers thought the intergenerational POVs unnecessary but I am inclined to disagree. I don't know what to say but reconciling "chineseness" and queerness is a vastly different experience from that of a white person coming out. Certain passages touched me where a non-Chinese may found patronizing and tedious. LNATTC may felt like a universal depiction of being sapphic but at the core of it, it's a story of a girl caught between worlds and learning to reconcile with her intersectional identity. I urge everyone to read it.  A reread almost two years later. I still LOVE this book! It contains so much and yet is so very readable! Now I'm very anxious to read A Scatter of Light!! Excellent topics to prompt discussion!Initial review:This was an absolutely amazing read! This felt so accurate, genuine, and sincere. Lily and Kath are both struggling to identify their individual sexuality and then their own identity as a “couple.” I could appreciate the ‘underground’ sense of their lives as women loving other women in a way that included sexual interaction. Thank goodness our world has become more accepting and in some instances respectful of such feelings, if not exactly appreciative…yet! Each of us is an individual and unique in so many aspects. The way we understand the world. The way in which we think and learn. Why not diversity in sexuality? I just don't understand why that is so scary to some, specifically those who identify as "heterosexual"/cisgender. (BTW, I am one of those...) Just because it is something that is perhaps 'new-to-you' that doesn't mean it is bad...or wrong...or denoting mental/emotional instability. Live. And. Let. Live. Life is short. Use every opportunity to expand your own understanding and acceptance in this lifetime! And who knows? You may even grow to actually appreciate others for who they are. (Let us hope...) My fingers are crossed!  I had no idea I was going to like this book so much. I am extremely picky about historical fiction and teen fiction, and if I sense something is written as an "issue" book, I get turned off. Malinda Lo really brings to life the lesbian underground bars of he 50s, San Francisco, and particularly China Town, the fears of McCarthy's black list, and the excitement of forbidden first love. Her writing is extremely immersive. Lily is 17, Chinese American, smart, and is sort of overshadowed by her best friend who is often unkind to her. One day in school she meets Kath, and is dumbfounded by her attraction to her. In the 50s, homosexuality was illegal, shameful and compounded with her family's expectation of her being the good Chinese girl, this is an extremely scary realization. Lily and Kath are portrayed as realistic people. When Lily gets the opportunity to sneak out to the infamous Telegraph Club, a local lesbian bar with a famed male impersonator, she discovers a whole subculture she never knew of. This book is complex, with realistic characters with real problems. The historical setting is very well handled, and the potential consequences of veering from societal norms are hefty - imprisonment, deportation, institutionalization, etc... I now need to seek out Malinda Lo's other works, since I was surprised by how much I really enjoyed this one. It reminded me of a later, differently set Tipping the Velvet.   my full review here: i keep picking up mediocre books | reading vloghttps://youtu.be/YDPjEihMBtQ Definetely going to be one of my all time favourites. Absolutely in love with this book. The brilliant writing and the short historical information at the end… It taught me so much and made me feel so many things. I saw a part of myself and my experiences as a lesbian, and learned my community’s history while also being educated about Asian American lesbians’ experiences in particular and how culture and queerness interact. I almost cried a couple of times for Lily. I loved both Lily and Kath. Their courage and will to exist as who they are inspired me in so many ways. Thank you Malinda Lo for creating this masterpiece.UPDATE: Reread after almost exactly 1 year and I still can’t believe how much research went into this book. It’s just amazing. It’s a masterpiece. I also still can’t read the last 100 pages without feeling pain. It reminds me so much of my own experience (although definetely different) that it pains me so much to read. I understand Lily so well, and the book is written so well that you can emphathize really easily with what Lily is going through, though being a lesbian and having gone through similar experiences makes it easier. This book is like a mirror to what the lesbian experience is like, and how painful coming out can be. It’s definetely a must read book in my opinion. It has so many dimensions, and tackles multiple topics at the same time so masterfully.  i went into this with high expectations and boy were they met!this book perfectly captures the way it feels to discover your queer self and even though lily could not be any more different than me, i found her thoughts and inner workings so very relatable.as a chinese-american living in san franciscos chinatown in the 50s, the only thing lily and i myself share is our queerness. however, malinda lo writes in an almost universal language of what longing for finding and discovering yourself and your sexuality feels like. i don't think i've ever read another book that represented so perfectly what it feels like to realise these kinds of things about yourself. it felt absolutely natural and i loved reading it so much because it was just so real! and to think, even seventy years ago, people felt the same things i did just a few years ago. this was no less than perfectly executed.don't get me wrong though, this book deals with some heavy themes and it made me shed quite a few tears here and there, moments where i just wanted to pull lily out of the pages and hug her. that combination of uncertainty and undying curiosity was what drew me in so much. there is no certain happy or sad ending and we are left only with the hope of a better future for the two girls. i devoured this book within hours and when it was over i wished i could forget it all just to read it again. probably one of my favorite lesbian fiction pieces.  hace mucho no lloraba con un libro tengo muchas emociones juntas !!! seria un 5 si no hubiese quedado medio inconcluso lo de kath llegando al final~ I don't often read historical without any fantasy elements, but it can feel a little slow to me. This one did feel slow at the beginning, but I am also a very impatient reader. Someone who is more into historicals probably won't find it slow. I loved Lily's voice and her character. The supporting characters were also great, and I appreciated seeing Lily's friendship with Shirley and how that friendship was fracturing before Shirley found out Lily was a lesbian. Shirley has her own goals and secrets, and it was nice to see a supporting character so well fleshed out. I don't know much about the 1950's in San Francisco, or much about San Francisco, so that was fun to read about, and especially with a queer Asian American girl at the center of the story. This is a deep, multi-layered book and it's so important (and fun) to see queer characters in historicals as it pushes back against the erroneous belief that the queer community is somehow new. Lily's desire for that community, her growing feelings for Kath, and her wish to work with computers and rockets made her a compelling character that kept my reading until the very end. A detailed author's notes and suggested reading round this great novel. Give this to anyone who likes historicals, queer characters, and bittersweet coming of age stories.   It's 1954 and Lily is a high school senior, one of two girls in Advanced Math. She sits with Kath, who she has known for years but something new clicks between them. This is a gorgeous look at Lily, a Chinese American lesbian figuring out her identify in Chinatown and its gay club with Kath. I was initially staggered by the 600+ pages, and then had to read the end first because my capacity for unhappy endings has practically disappeared in this pandemic. It's a deeply complex novel, primarily Lily's story with scenes from other characters. Layered, messy, hard as Lily struggles with herself. Being Chinese American when the government has taken her father's papers, being attracted to Kath and a male impersonator, her oldest friendship splintering, feeling different also because she loves math and wants to work at the JPL with her aunt, and what felt like a little anxiety and depression. Parts were hard to read even though the writing was gorgeous and every character nuanced. So much casual racism tossed around—new people always asking those around Lily if she spoke English, being called China Doll, etc.The author's notes and summary of what she learned and where was absolutely fascinating. It was very hard to tease out Asian American lesbian history but she found a few wonderful activities and people. So much history has been lost to shame and secrecy.  this book was very very good in terms of exploring how the identity of being both a lesbian and being chinese american would intersect in terms of prejudice and oppression, especially in the 1950s. this wasn't very romance centric but i did enjoy a lot of the chinese culture the author wrote about, and lily was an intriguing and relatable protagonist. besides the sexuality part of it all, the way the author switches povs sometimes to lily's mother and aunt and exploring their chinese american identity and their disconnectfrom their native country since they were born in america was just,,, muah. this book had no big problems with it, it just didn't change my life or anything. it was enjoyable even though i must add that there is uncomfortable and casual racism from white lesbians throughout the pages, even using a slur that was common at the time to address chinese women, so beware. and also, obviously, lots of homophobia from lily's family as a whole, though i absolutely adore her little brother who is just a fucking champ. overall, as a chinese american lesbian, 2.5 stars, but for my fellow sapphics: don't go into it looking for it to be romance centric or you'll be disappointed. this is a book about being queer and poc in the 1950s, even if there is a romance of sorts. rep: chinese lesbian mc, lesbian li   Malinda Lo did a beautiful job in crafting a story that weaves together multiple themes, such as the immigrant experience, the pressures of family, Chinese traditions, homosexuality, and love, and writes them in the context of post-WW2 America. Although there were many layers, everything came together in order to contribute to this realistic portrayal of life as a young women of colour during a time in which every action and decision could be easily scrutinized.The prose was mature, elegant and incredibly imaginative, and I liked how bits and pieces of Cantonese and Mandarin were scattered throughout the book. This book honestly didn't feel like it was YA, which I loved, and I truly felt like Malinda Lo's prose triggered all my senses.As for characters, I truly loved Lily and Kath. Their interactions were adorable, innocent and just so genuine that I felt the butterflies and their connection to one another easily. Lily's development was also just *chef's-freaking-kiss*This book practically wrecked me, kept me up at night, on edge for hours. I am currently experiencing a book hangover. Super happy that this was my first read for May and AAPI Heritage Month. If you're into historical fiction, YA or romance, I highly recommend grabbing this one because it's way too beautiful for it not to be read.  Set in 1954, Lily Hu is a 17-year-old Chinese immigrant living in San Francisco. Lily spends her whole life mingling with her Chinese classmates - until she meets Kathleen Miller. Through the interaction, Lily learns about the scenes of the White lesbian community in her town and her sexual orientation.Concurrently, they are living in the period of the Red Scare: where Asians are deemed as Communists and posing threats in the US during the Cold War. Asians are constantly being regulated and deported for any suspicious acts in the country. Between the responsibility for her family and truly embracing her identity, Lily is facing a tough decision.Malindo Lo did a great job in setting up the scene of San Francisco in the 1950s and the Asian community. Also, the timestamps throughout the book and the author's note at the end is helpful for readers to grasp this part of American history!However, I didn't fully vibe with Lo's writing. It can be pretty mundane and often lingers on minor details. While the book spans over 400 pages, there wasn't much plot and character development.If you're looking for a non-overwhelming story on the topics of homosexuality, racism and AAPI discrimination, this book serves as a great entry point to read and learn about.Rating: 3.75 stars  perdónentiendo todo el laburo que hay detrás de este libro. entiendo lo que la autora intentó hacer. no me animo a decir que no lo logro, pero para mi no fue suficiente para disfrutarlo. de a ratos sentía que estaba leyendo dos libros distintos. por un lado, la historia de lily y su relación con kath y, por el otro, toda la cuestión del comunismo. hacia el final esas dos cosas confluyen pero no de la mejor manera. los capítulos con backstory de los padres de lily y su tía fueron raros, me interesaron poco y nada y los terminé salteando. siento que malinda lo intentó hacer algo demasiado ambicioso y el resultado fue un libro desmembrado, poco conciso, con un ritmo bastante lento. estaba muy ansiosa por leer un libro setteado en los 50 pero la atmósfera no estuvo bien lograda. los personajes también se sintieron algo acartonados, siento que cada uno cumplía su rol determinado y nada más, no los sentí verosímiles.creo que mi principal problema es que ya no estoy para leer libros young adult, hay procedimientos típicos del género que me molestan demasiado y me impiden disfrutar del libro en general. pero quizás este sea tu nuevo libro favorito así que. si la sinopsis te llama, leelo. espero que lo disfrutes más que yo.  Achich, tohle je přesně kniha mého gusta. Překrásně napsaný, pomalý, něžný příběh o dvou obyčejných dívkách, které v sobě postupně nalézají zalíbení. Rozměr tomu dodává fakt, že se to odehrává v 50. letech, takže je vám určitě jasné, že ta doba lesbickému vztahu zrovna moc nepřála. Nejen, že vás čekalo silné nepochopení rodiny, ale podobný vztah byl vlastně do určité míry i trestný.Další hloubku tomuto příběhu dodává fakt, že hlavní hrdinka Lily je Američanka čínského původu. V té době byl v USA obří strašák komunismus, takže podezření z toho, že jste čínský špión, mohlo vzniknout z jakéhokoliv důvodu. A právě to, čemu rodina Lily čelí a jak se cítí, má v příběhu stejně velké množství prostoru jako její první láska.Nebudu vám lhát, tahle kniha není pro každého. A to už jen tím, že patří spíš k těm těžším knížkám v angličtině. Ale jestli hledáte něco pomalého, citlivého, co vám ukáže svět zas trochu jinýma očima, tak ji zkuste. Osobně jsem měla při čtení stejné pocity jako když jsem četla The Miseducation of Cameron Post od Emily M. Danforth, tak jestli se vám Cameron též líbila, rozhodně musíte zkusit i tohle.Každopádně tohle je první kniha, kterou za rok 2022 zahrnu mezi to nejlepší čtení.  Gay marriage was only just legalized in America in 2015 across all 50 states. This book takes place in 1954 in San Francisco, nestled deep in the cracks of Chinatown and hidden in the shadows outside the Telegraph club. This book’s unique perspective—one of a girl confronting both her sexuality and culture, 61 years before gay marriage would be legitimized—is something I’ve never really seen before. It takes you into the smoky atmosphere of the club itself, let’s you sit down at the bar and watch the show alongside Lily. With such rich description and language true to the era it really feels like you’re there beneath the neon lights, buzzed from the performers and the anxiety of getting caught. Lily is one of the strongest characters I’ve ever read about. She deals with everything head on, so courageous and unapologetically herself. She’s admirable in the way she doesn’t back down, even if there are tears in her eyes. Books like these—books that explore sexuality and youth and culture and gender all together are what young people need. Being able to read something that can seem so real, so /familiar/ is so important when sometimes all you feel is alone. It’s amazing to have books like this out in the world—especially when you need them.   2.5 stars — I’ll start with what I did like:I liked the vibes of the telegraph club, Kath and Lily’s relationship, the concept of the book as a whole. The execution is unfortunately a different story. None of the characters had any distinguishable personality. If the names were taken away from the dialogue, I would have no idea who was talking. Why is the MC’s only trait liking math and space???I understand that this book is more plot driven than character driven, but that honestly just brings up the other big issue I had with this book — none of the “big events” are followed through with, except the climax where Kath gets “arrested.” There’s a vague threat of (capital) Communist (capital) Calvin but that goes no where lol. Finally, going along with plotting/pacing problems is just general filler problems. I really don’t understand the purpose of the chapters from the older women’s perspectives. If I had skipped them I wouldn’t have missed anything. I’m honestly so disappointed in this book. The concept had me so excited!!!! I feel terrible giving even a 2.5 rating because of how high the general rating here is but I don’t want to settle for sapphic representation for the sake of it. Thanks if you’ve read this far mwah &lt;3 Great book! I nearly cried at the end. Out of hope and relief. But that's kind of a spoiler. The characters and storyline are so believable. It feels so realistic and thought through. The part at the end explaining decisions and use of language and even historical context is amazing and shows how much thought went into it. I read the book around the Berlin CSD so it was absolutely fitting and stood in great contrast to all the change we already achieved. Even though queer people are now able to openly celebrate themselves, there is still a need for more content that shows this pride and happiness or generally just show queer people and especially further queer minorities and their experiences. I'm thankful for this option the book gave me and I wish the past could have been better. But this just illustrates that we need Pride, the month, event and also pride for ourselves. We should not have to deny ourselves because we internalized the hatred and fear of the otherness in us. We should not have to hate ourselves. P. S. Sorry for the tangent. Kind of got lost there. Not even sure anymore if I had a further point to make. P. P. S. Yes I did. I was missing something, that's why I couldn't give 5 full stars. I just don't know what it was. Adorei este livro! 😍E aprendi tanto com ele…É um livro sobre o primeiro amor, a descoberta sexual e de identidade… Mas também um livro sobre a repressão sexual, o racismo e a cultura chinesa na América nos anos 50.Lily, uma adolescente chinesa fica frente a frente com a descoberta da sua orientação sexual, com os sentimentos a nascer por Kath e por a mente dela não estar preparada para isso.Numa sociedade que estava formatada para casar e ter filhos e que, a homossexualidade era tratada como uma doença mental.Achei fantástica o relato do desenvolvimento desta descoberta, a forma como Lily começa a ver as coisas à sua volta, a olhar para os corpos das mulheres de outra forma, apaixonar-se e tomar as suas próprias decisões… A escritora narrou muito bem estes pormenores, o que me fez ficar com um pouco de revolta pela sociedade daqueles tempos.E não só, porque hoje em dia a sociedade esteja diferente neste aspecto, existem idiotas que ficaram parados nos anos 50. Mas eu acredito que o mundo está a adaptar-se e o que mais importante é sermos felizes!(Nota-se um bocado que é o meu primeiro romance sáfico, não é? 😅)Desculpem o desabafo, mas adorei mesmo este livro e esta história! 🤍Confesso que, só esperava um bocadinho mais do final, embora compreenda o porquê. 🫣🫣  4.5 starsThis is a delightful coming of age / finding your identity story, but there is so much more to this book.The writing of the budding romance is just heart melting and written with such honesty, sincerity and rawness - it definitely takes you back to those teenage moments of first love. The book also tells the story of Chinese immigrants to the US in the period before and after World War II, and the political turmoil of China at this time. As a history buff, I appreciate the obviously detailed research that has gone into this book. I was able to look up many of the events and places described and find images and information about them.I also appreciate that the author is keeping the voices and events true to the era. Too many historical fictions are written that alter details like this to fit our modern sensibilities. But that wasn't how it was and we should be able to accept that and realise that things have changed. I think it is important to recognise that.Overall, a wonderful book as it covers so much territory without seeming stretched or forced. Beautifully written.   3.5. This historical fiction transported me to the San Franciscan landscape of the 1950s — I could actually envision the streets of Chinatown! The storytelling of Lily Hu’s coming-of-age is genuine, and we follow along as she discovers her identity as a queer person and also as an ambitious career-driven woman in a traditional society that upholds men. One word I’d use to describe this book is soft. Although the writing felt incredibly authentic, it also felt a little muted, and perhaps there is something there as softness is a prominent attribute of most Chinese-Americans, especially during that time period. However, because of this softness, the first half of the book wasn’t particularly gripping and was a little harder to get into. Regardless, I appreciated this novel overall, and am thrilled that such a story exists. Queer teenagers, set in the 1950s, taboo night clubs, the Asian diaspora experience, battling identity against societal/family traditions, and set in North America??? Hell to the yes.  Beautiful, show stopping, marvelous, the standard we should all hope to strive for. This book tackled so many different concepts of identity, history, community, and personal struggles in only 400 pages, and yet it was done flawlessly. As a history nerd, I really respected the amount of research that was put into preparation for this novel in order to make it as historically accurate as possible. Not to mention the further notes and list of sources that was included at the end being the delicious icing on the cake. Lily and Kath, my little baby gays, were so adorable. Following their storyline as they grew closer and discovered this important part of themselves together was amazing and made me cry with love. Also how they discovered an entire community during their journey, giving them a safe space to grow and blossom and come to terms with who they were. I really respected Lily as well, her bravery and the way she stayed firm in who she was was really inspirational and beautiful.I highly recommend this to everyone   Phenomenal writing that captures the intensity of sexuality and race in the 1950s. Beautiful book. I loved this book, as you might expect. Lesbians? History? A protagonist who reads science fiction and dreams of space and rockets? Mouth-watering descriptions of food? Self-discovery? Young romance with both depth and dreaminess? I'm in! I loved Malinda Lo's short story in the anthology All Out: The No-Longer-Secret Stories of Queer Teens throughout the Ages (Which is absolutely amazing, whether you are a teen or an adult, queer or not. If you haven't read it, I highly recommend taking a look.) so I was excited when I saw Last Night at the Telegraph Club available to me as an eARC from Edelweiss. Luckily, the story met (and exceeded!) my high expectations. It was exactly the book I was looking for. I can't wait to buy a copy when it is released.  So many things to love about LAST NIGHT AT THE TELEGRAPH CLUB by Melinda Lo.⁠ I love history and this slice of San Francisco in the 1950s was luscious. So many historical elements that haven't been written enough for YA, including Chinese Americans and their culture (food) and Cantonese and Mandarin scattered throughout the story some written in traditional Chinese characters.⁠Also, a lesbian first-love story⁠ (very tender), red-scare paranoia, gay bar raids by police and women making their first forays into STEM. I think what I love most about this novel is Lily's strength and courage as she comes to understand more about herself, and that she will not fit into the world her former friends and her parents and relative want her to. Her honesty and self-regard make her a model for young women.What I didn't love so much about this book. For me it moved too slowly. So many interesting threads were introduced, but did not play out with the kind of page-turning appeal I prefer.  If Virginia Woolf and Wong Kar-wei had a baby it could be the book. So atmospheric! So much yearning! Lovely, moody, quiet, languorously paced, suffused with longing. Vivid lipstick, sharp lapels, long looks and quick glances. Wonderful sense of time and place. A Chinese-American “good girl” in San Francisco in the ‘50s begins to realize she’s gay. She connects, chastely but romantically, with a white classmate, and discovers the world of a fictional lesbian nightclub with a charismatic drag-king star. The book is mostly Lily’s coming-out story, but it also flashes back in time to her parents’ courtship and her aunt’s work at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, all against a backdrop of prejudice and the Red Scare. Definitely long and slow but so lovely and also edifying (I say this as someone who used to live in SF and THOUGHT she knew the history of its LGBTQ community!). Highly recommended for adults and kids who vibe with historical fiction.  Wonderful! Wonderful! This was a very grounded and heartfelt f/f love story that left me quiet and soft. A novel about a Chinese American teenager in the 1950s as she falls for another girl when they visit The Telegraph Club. It's a standard premise, but I love the build and detailed story line. It felt very real and I felt very seen by the romance and the way they interact.I'm usually not a big fan of realistic dialogue (I remembered discovering Buffy the Vampire Slayer as a teen and being THRILLED), but I think snarky, quirky banter has grown almost oversaturated in the culture. This much more subdued and human dialogue was refreshing and I liked the honesty of it. I liked Lily slowly breaking out of the "follower" role she was cast in by Shirley and others; I liked Kath's shyness and growing into herself. There is a part of me that wanted more, more, more of their romance, but I think that's a sign of a good book.A wonderful read.  Lily Hu’s coming of age story is one of unexpected romance and struggling to find who you are at a time when being gay was seen as deviant.Taking place in mid-1950s San Francisco, we follow her during her senior year and while she awaits the upcoming celebration of the Chinese New Year, she feels like the odd one out in her loud circle of friends, except Kathleen. One night, she accompanies her friend to a lesbian bar and it will change their friendship into something deeper that could end up separating them. We also get a earlier story of Lily’s parents who are living during the Red Scare paranoia.It’s a slow moving story that’s about family, friendship, traditions, living difficult lives and falling in love. Lily is a very compelling protagonist who wants to become her own person, regardless of what others think. The final part before the bittersweet ending for me felt like it let a few loose ends unfinished, yet it doesn’t ruin this emotional story. A- (91%/Excellent)  This was a bittersweet book. Wish there was more at the end cause I felt it ended quite abruptly. I wish the historical notes were a bit more developed or better integrated with the main story. TW: Homophobia, racism, racial slursThank you Penguin Teen for providing me with an e-arc of the book!Historical fiction is a genre I don’t pick up much, but it is also a genre I want to start reading more of. Last Night at the Telegraph Club is a sapphic historical fiction that takes place in San Fransisco in the 1950s and follows an Asian-American teen named Lily. I loved hearing Lily talk about space travel and just science in general. I’m a sucker for books that has or talks about space travel, so this book was right up my alley. I adored the main relationship of the story and just loved seeing the two characters slowly fall for one another. Last Night at the Telegraph Club was one of my most anticipated books of 2021 and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a new historical fiction to read!  This is a coming-of-age story set in 1950s San Francisco that intersects the experiences of a second-generation Chinese-American woman, balancing the expectations of her family and culture with a geeky love of science fiction and math, in the midst of exploring her sexuality in the lesbian nightclubs of North Beach at the side of a new friend who shares all the interests that are drawing her away from the path laid out for a "good Chinese daughter." The story is a bildungsroman rather than a romance, though there is the promise of a happy ending for all the various threads. And the protagonist's discovery of her sexuality is only one of several central themes. In particular, Lo creates a vivid picture of the Chinese community in mid-century San Francisco, in all its complexity and contradictions.  The author put a lot of care, research, and personal history into this coming-of-age story of a Chinese-American lesbian growing up in a time and place that doesn’t allow both identities to coexist. She explores lesbian culture and Chinese-American culture, and the cultural anxiety surrounding it, and the sense of conformity and social repression prevalent in 1950’s America.While I appreciated how the storylines converged at the end, this was a suuuuper sloooow burn for me. I mean SLOOOOW. It started to pick up pace way late in the game. I was really disappointed during the first 2/3 of the book, and nearly moved on for good. I’m glad I hung on, and it breaks my heart to do this because it discusses such important topics, but I feel like I have to give it a less than favorable rating because it felt like a chore to read the first 250 pages.  this book was beautifully written, in so many ways. this book made me sob but also lifted me up. it made me sick to the stomach but also brought me so much serotonin. it describes the oppression women faced in the past, which some women still do. lily’s character development was so pretty, at the beginning, her opinions, thoughts, were entirely based on on her parents’ shirley’s, even though she never fully agreed since “there was something wrong with her”. u can see it when she picks up the sapphic book, the amount of internalized homophobia she had.after the confrontation with her mother, you can see how she stood up for herself, instead of lying to her mother, she faced it all. this book was painfully realistic, that’s why i loved it so much.definitely would recommend it a million times. easily 5 stars.  oh my GOD this book was so good (thanks queen carol). This has been one of the first (possibly only?) books i've read that properly encapsulated the feeling of realizing you like women and the shame that kind of comes with that and one of the first times I've actually felt like I related to the mc struggling with this. Also loved how historically accurate it was AND the extra notes in the back which were a really great read. Very important to touch on the white-centricity of queer spaces and history and this book definitely puts it into perspective well. Also despite the time period didn't feel like the same old lesbian tragedy, definitely felt hopeful despite the circumstances and managed to keep it feeling that way without being fluffy or dismissive of the actual problems asian-americans and lesbians faced in the US in the 50s. Love love love.  This was just an okay read for me. Nothing particularly special or anything. I think this author and her writing, for some reason, is always just okay for me since I've read her previous books years ago and I felt the same - just okay, nothing special.However, the one thing that did stood out to me was the historical element and how the MC was an asian person who was trying to hide the fact that she was not straight, There were discussions about family expectations as well as the cultural differences as she navigated America during that time period. I found that super fascinating and could see why the MC was terrified about coming out to her family.If it wasn't for that, I would've given this book 2* or even 1* because the writing and the plot was just mediocre and not particularly interesting.   Last Night at the Telegraph Club won the 2021 National Book Award, so I've had this one on my list for a few months now. This is a very sweet, sad, and important book. Lily is immediately likeable and it's easy to feel empathetic toward her. The romance between her and Kath is just so darn cute, but my favourite part of this book was probably the Telegraph Club itself - it was a safe haven for the San Francisco lesbian community and the characters introduced through Lily's time there were so fun and interesting. I also loved the author's notes on both the historical aspects of the book and the linguistic choices she made - this may be the first book I've ever read with traditional Chinese characters used in conversations. This book was so unique and the story so important, the title of National Book Award was definitely well-deserved.  Last Night At The Telegraph Club is a coming of age story of a sixteen year old Chinese American girl in the 1950s, discovering the world of lesbianism and her first love (as well as dealing with racism, possible deportation and other issues of that period)..I'm not used to reading historical fiction, I'm aware that queer history is very painful and I often don't want to subject myself to pain and sadness.But this story, although it is obviously not all sunshine and rainbows, still remains quite positive and hopeful. Lily finds her place, finds people like her, she finds love and she finds a way to stand up for herself despite the world being against her. And I appreciated that so much. Seeing her discover this world she can be herself in, a world that says "yes, you are valid and you can be happy just as you are" felt heartwarming beyond belief.  jag vet inte riktigt vad det var som gjorde det, men jag tyckte verkligen jättemycket om den här. Kanske var det så många små detaljer som tillsammans gjorde att den kändes så äkta? Gillade tidslinjen med händelser som dök upp ibland, sättet att baka in kantonesiska och mandarin när karaktärerna pratade med varandra, hur tidsenlig till 50-talet den kändes OCH det bästa, Lily och Kath. Älskade hur de båda fick nörda i matte. Hur de hade sina specialintressen, flygplan och rymden. Och hur de var intresserades av att höra varandra prata om varandras intressen och uppmuntrade varandra. Detta och så mycket mer bidrog nog till hur nära och äkta och berörande det var att läsa om Lily och Kaths historia. Det var typ också väldigt lärorikt? Att få en inblick hur det kunde vara att leva som lesbisk kines-amerikan i San Francisco i mitten på 50-talet.   Though it took me the first quarter of the book or so to really be hooked on the story, I liked this book a lot. At the halfway point, the plot really starts moving, and the details throughout are excellent. Between the clothes people choose, to the different environments the characters find themselves in, all of it seemed really well researched. Maybe we didn't have to know EVERY street name the characters walk down, but that's ok. Having been to North Beach/Chinatown several times, it was fun to read about somewhat familiar places as they would have been in the early '50s. I also appreciated reading a YA book that felt real. Nobody has a twee name, the ending isn't tidy, and the treatment of romance (and acting upon it) felt true to life, no matter the decade. Definitely recommend this one.  4.5 STARSLast Night at the Telegraph Club was exactly the book I needed. I can’t express enough how much a queer book about a Chinese character in the Bay Area means to me. There were so many moments when I just felt my heart pull out of my chest for Lily. Her struggles about being a “perfect Chinese daughter” were so real and apparent. I loved the Chinese culture that was sprinkled throughout the book. I also loved the multiple POVs we got from Lily’s family. One thing I wasn’t expecting was the footnotes, but those were pleasantly surprising. I wish we got a chance to learn more about Kath as a character, and toward the middle, the book felt a little slow. But Last Night at the Telegraph Club is absolutely incredible and I would highly recommend it.  Last Night at the Telegraph Club is a coming of age / romance / historical fiction story about an American Chinese girl named Lily in 1950s San Francisco who discovers a gay bar. Lily has to navigate school, family, racial prejudice, rumours of communism, and her first love. Although there's still a way to go, it made me think how far we've come since then with regards to being inclusive of LGBTQ+ and how difficult and different it must have been for people in the past.You can really see the details, heart, and research the author has put into writing the book, and as well as that, I liked Lily as a main character, and there was a few supporting characters that were great too.&nbsp; First love is always so powerful and consuming and I think we never forget it ❤️🏳️‍🌈  I love love loved this. As Lily navigated newfound queer spaces as a Chinese American lesbian, I was entraced by the writing, unique characters, and message of this book. I found myself learning along with Lily about 1950s queer culture and history, and as a young queer individual myself, I really appreciated the author’s way of introducing new topics to Lily. The characters, particularly Lana and Tommy Andrews, both struck me as so real, even small things such as the lighter and books in their apartment just added to the wonderful characterization. Everything about this is amazing. The representation. The hard topics. Lily’s childhood relationships, and the conflict within them. EVERYTHING! It now reigns as of my favorite books!!!  *4.5this book was so important and beautiful and i’ve been wanting to read it ever since it came out so it definitely met my expectations. Lily is a great character, she felt so real to me because i’m Chinese American so it felt like i was reading about myself (we love representation)!!! the setting and food felt so familiar to me and the historical element was so good and well woven into a romance, coming of age, and sapphic novel. i’m so glad a book like this exists so that people like me can see themselves and relate to this amazing story. the ending was sad, but gave a good amount of closure. i highly recommend this book for any gay or asian teen because i feel like it is so comforting to be able to see yourself in a story.  Honestly just a bit too YA for my taste. I picked it up bc the main character has my last name so… I had to right? The choices of what to elaborate on and what to assume the reader already knows are all out of whack. Maybe it’s just because I did a whole thesis on the McCarthy era but like… there was so much potential and I didn’t really love any part of it? When I was in high school I dated a girl in secret for a month and that relationship ended when our parents found out and made us stay apart for the rest of…ever. So trust me when I say if ANYONE was going to relate to this book it was gonna be me. Making me slug through all that hoping I would have a moment where it clicked all for that pointless ending was, I’ll say it, quite frankly homophobic 🫤  *4.5 stars* such a beautiful book that has me feeling overly protective of lily, my little baby !! the way she found herself throughout this book really hit home for me and i just want to give her the biggest hug EVER.the only reason i’m not rating this higher is just bc i didn’t feel attached to the ship and any other character but lily (eventhough i understand kaths importance, she didn’t stick out to me) and the flashbacks were a little boring to me, as well as the cold war shit (i LOVE the historical aspect when it comes to homosexuality and can’t stress enough how important this book was for the community, but i didn’t care for the war stuff when i spent 2 years learning ab it my gosh). anyway, this was a great read that will definitely be on my mind for a few days.ps. fuck shirley   Instant favorite. Complex and full of love and respect through explorations of race and racism, shame and guilt and internalized homophobia, PTSD, immigration and citizenship, class and classism, Cold War politics. I really like that even side characters are given a lot of depth, which seems to mirror how people like them have stories to tell despite never being at the forefront of history. It was beautifully written. ** another thing I found incredibly important was the deliberate depiction of racism by white lesbians. Specifically, the way white lesbian characters spewed the same racist rhetoric as white cishets, word for word. That shit still happens. LGBTQ+ people can find community across identity lines, but whiteness is never entirely safe for poc. **   infinitely bittersweet - chinese lesbian who’s obsessed with outer space because she feels like she doesn’t belong and falls in love with another girl also obsessed with the sky and science? like lily is literally me …. I could gush about this book forever and how i loved all the characters and how well it was written my god . And it was so painful to read most of the time because every scene felt so real and relatable - i just want to hold lily and kath in my heart forever … made me want a taste of love to see if it feels like floating and flying, to revel in all its tender and messy moments &lt;//333  This is one of those historical novels that manages to make you nostalgic for a time you weren't even around for. Did I know that I wanted to walk along a hot street, eating a scoop of ginger ice cream in 1950s San Francisco? No. Will I now be reading every book set during this time I can get my hands on? Probably! The romance between Lily and Kath takes a long time (most of the book) to get going and we never really get to find out much about Kath, beyond the fact that she's a lesbian and likes maths. But Lily is such a rich character that her world is more than enough to sustain the entire novel and make me earmark all Lo's other books.  I listened to this one on audio, and I can see what all of the hub-bub is about.Lily is a Chinese-American girl, living in Chinatown in San Fransico in the 1950's. There are a lot of different things going on in this one.*the Red Scare*LGBTQ discrimination*Chinese Americans in US society*expectations of women and menAnd, I'm sure, more than that. I appreciated the ending of the novel a great deal because I found it realistic, not storybook. The reactions to Lily being gay from ALL of the characters--including Lily herself--I appreciated. There was a wide range, and I found all of them believable.Recommended historic fiction for all ages.  ok so probably 3.5, just because i didn’t really like it that much until the last quarter, but those last sixty pages were a ride! i think what made me like this book was how relatable it was to a young queer teen still finding herself. the romance was cute, and the plot was well-written.i have such high expectations for writing styles now, and maybe this one just didn’t make the cut? i don’t know, i think there’s something missing, maybe it was the ending. i really wish we’d seen more after she moves, but maybe that’s just me. or maybe it’s just my hate for shirley.overall a great book for anyone. definitely happy i read it.  I'd give this book a 2.8/5 stars. This was one of those books that you truly think you'll love but then it ends up being very slow and boring. The cover is amazing and gorgeous but thats the thing; Id say the cover is more interesting than the boo itself. One thing that did not at all help me like this book more was the numerous times the n word was used. Im sure that it was more than 5 times and though this book was set in the 1950's it felt so unnecessary to use the word. I was really looking forward to a queer poc romance but i think i'll have to find another one because this wasn't for me.  This was so much more than I ever expected. I laughed, I cried, I squealed; this book brought all the emotions. It's incredibly well-written, and the story and characters had me invested in them from chapter one. Why don't I give it five stars? I was really not a fan of how every so often the perspective would change to a different person, place, and time for one chapter. It was rarely the same person twice, and, in my opinion, didn't really contribute much to the story. It broke up the fluidity of the writing, and made the story slightly less enjoyable. Overall, I really liked this book, and think it's an important read for everyone.   4.5 This was just great. It was such an immersive read--descriptions of San Francisco, Chinatown, of the club, of apartments and fateful evenings. It felt really layered, several themes and conflicts converging into something really interesting and completely its own. Whenever I sat down to read, I always felt completely drawn in. Feelings and situations were drawn in a way that felt true and real and relatable. My only complaints is that while I understand why they're there, the flashbacks/different POV chapters didn't really add a lot for me. It also dragged just a little around the halfway mark, but then it really picks up again after that.   the only thing i didn't really like was the ending, because it felt rushed and incomplete. the rest of this was insanely good This is one of those “against all odds” romances that I absolutely cannot resist. Lily is Chinese American and lives in San Francisco’s Chinatown in 1954. When her friend Kathleen takes her to the Telegraph Club, a place where queer people can be their true selves, something clicks into place and Lily starts to understand herself in a new way. But it won’t be easy to be true to herself and her feelings for Kathleen, either among her own family or in the insular community she grew up in. A gorgeous, wrenching coming of age novel and a love story wrapped into one.   I took my time savoring Malinda Lo's beautiful and bittersweet Last Night at the Telegraph Club. There are so many thing's that Lo does beautifully in this book but probably what caught me the most was the exquisite human intelligence that Lo has in capturing the emotions of Lily and the world she lives in. Not since Rainbow Rowell's Eleanor and Park have I been so invested in a first love and finding yourself story. I can't help but want Lo to continue to tell the stories of the other characters in this book, especially Aunt Judy.   I think this book was the most beautiful, realistic queer coming of age story I’ve ever read. From the little ways Lily starts to notice women to her attraction and eventual romance with Kath, the whole thing was spot on. I loved watching Lily grow throughout the novel and how she found her voice. The novel also brought in a lot of lesbian history and Chinese American history which added even more depth to the story. I truly loved this novel and can’t wait to reread it. I’d recommend it to anyone, queer or straight.   I devoured this book, it was so good!! I loved what this book had to say about finding out who you are, coming out, first love, and living in the 1950s. My coming out story is vastly different than Lily's and yet I saw so much of my teenage self in her. There are a couple of flashbacks that I didn't feel were necessary and some plot points that are never tied up but how this made me feel emotionally is why I'm giving it 5 stars (otherwise it'd be a 4). Also please give me more lesbian stories with butches, the literary world needs more of them.  “Are you like the girls in the book too? Because I think I am.” I really liked the story and the main characters. I thought the love story between Kath and Lily was very cute. It was refreshing to see that both Lily and Kath had dreams and ambitions that lay outside of what was considered normal for women of that time and they didn’t waver on them during the book. The addition of chapters from the adults point of views really added a real depth to the historic story line that might would have fallen flat without it. Overall I really liked it and think that it’s a worthwhile read!   4.5 rated up. “she felt a queer giddiness overtaking her, as if her body might float up from the ground because she was so buoyant with this lightness, this love.”this book took me ages to read but i think it’s because i don’t really have any new books to read afterwards.this book encompassed the queer coming out experience well as she comes out to her parents near the end.i quite read this book and it was pretty good and i enjoyed the romance side of it and the chinese heritage and culture of it and the ending was soo good  Taking into consideration what this book is, and what it aims to do, it did a great job. This book offered a view into to a largely forgotten group of people (LGBTQ+ BIPOC) in history, and it explored important and powerful topics such as identity and racism. Also, I found the story to be well researched, and I am fascinated by historical fiction set in the 1950s and beyond. However, I'm a plot-driven reader and wish the story gave me more content to mull over. I felt the book ended at the beginning, and left me with more questions than answers.  my interests-lesbians-communismSo obviously I loved this book. I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because I feel like the pacing was slow for most of the book and then all of a sudden sped up at the end. Still, this book beautifully captures 1950s lesbian culture and Chinese culture and how Lily is stuck between these two spaces. As someone who has sat through so many white sapphic romance novels just for a bit of representation, this book is like a warm hug. Truly one of the first books where I’ve felt seen.   likely one of the most believable historical fiction novels i've&nbsp;read.&nbsp;the characters have a lot of depth to them, and their dynamics are complex in a way that makes them feel realistic. i absolutely love the writing style, and the author explores both the main character's cultural identity and sexuality in such an emotional way. i did struggle through certain parts of the story, but that's mainly because i was in a reading slump prior to picking this one up. overall, a really beautiful yet painful story.  Most young adult fiction deals with personal discovery, but rarely has that journey been depicted so beautifully, so intricately, and so honestly as in Last Night at the Telegraph club. This is a story told in shared fleeting moments, subtle glances, and thoughts so quiet they’re louder than anything spoken. It’s about catching a glimpse of a world you only dared dream exist, chasing after it, and then being reminded that reality won’t let you get too far away. And it is about being seen, just a little, for exactly who you are, and then fighting to keep every bit of your newfound self.  second time reading this and i still enjoyed it so much! it is a little slow at some parts, so i'm glad i listened to the audiobook both times. this was one of the first books i'd read featuring a sapphic main couple, and it had an extremely important and impactful role on me accepting myself and coming to love queer historical fiction. this book will always hold a very special place in my heart because of it 💕  Beautiful and touching, and definitely made me cry a bit. I loved how it approached Lily's experience of being lesibian and being Chinese American. Her character development and journey with sexuality felt so fluid and natural. And I appreciated how it went into what her parents, aunt, and uncle went through. The historical context was effectively woven into the narrative. Overall, a very well-written story. Highly recommend.  Ash by Malinda Lo was the first book I ever read with a sapphic protagonist and it's definitely something that opened my eyes to my own sexuality. All that to say, I love that this book now exists for young people going through the same thing. I absolutely loved this and read the entirety of it in 24 hours. I'd recommend reading the author's note at the end as well for some background of the actual history that inspired this story. A new favorite for sure.   3/5. Well, how do I begin. The book was slow paced at first, but then after a while it got fast-paced. There were a lot of like throwbacks chapters in the book, only I had no idea what it had to do with the story, it just didn't make any sens for me. At the end, I felt like I had skipped a chapter or two because there was some information left out, and it just skipped to the epilogue, which was one year later.   i thought the prologue chapters for every part were unnecessary and boring; they took me out of the story. i also thought that Kath wasn't that developed of a character, and i found Lily's interactions with her family and her best friend more interesting to read about. however, despite this, it is still my favourite book. it changed something fundamentally in me. also, i really liked the historical aspect of this book. it actually made me more interested in historical fiction in general.   This book pulls together the protagonist's multiple identities without feeling preachy or like a history textbook: Chinese-American, a girl with STEM interests, and a lesbian. I'm glad Lo included historical notes to accompany the text. The erasure of gay and lesbian people from history, especially people of color, perpetuates stigma and prejudice. This was an excellent audiobook as well, Emily Woo Zeller is my favorite narrator and she was perfect for this. Definitely a favorite for 2021.   An incredibly well researched spotlight on a fascinating time in history - 1950s San Francisco for a queer Chinese American. I loved how much the story extended beyond the teenage protagonist, showing us the lives of her parents and relatives both in America and China. The lesbian club was developed with a real nuance and complexity. Staggeringly good, and worthy of all the awards it is receiving.  Overall I liked it and the end made me very emotional. I gave it 3.5 stars because there were too many scenes that were slow for me in the first half of the book and maybe this is just me but before the two love interests got together there was just a lack of romantic/physical chemistry for me. On the positive side I did really enjoy the historical fiction aspect of the book and when the two love interests got together the book really picked up for me.  I don't even have that much to say - it's a brilliant, at times heart-wrenching story with a beautifully painted narrative. It carries so much nuance and touches on so many topics I would not usually think abour delving into - I've never been that much interested in the specifics of Asian American culture in the 1950s seeing as I'm from a different continent, different time - but I loved every word of this book and I'm glad I reached for it. I would recommend it to anyone.  this book touched me in places of my heart that no book has ever before. i felt i could relate to lily and yet her story felt like something i would never understand. i loved this book so so much, the excitement, tenderness, the anxiety, i wish i could read it all for the first time again.after learning about how chinese and lgbtq+ people were treated in america in the 50s, i’m so much more grateful for the generation that i’m living in.  4.5/5 I loved it so much, it was a beautiful romance book but also enlightening on how Chinese Americans lived in the 50s and also their amazing culture. it also depicted the lesbian culture back in 50s and that was insightful to how they lived back then which was really sad 😔 I also cried a little so that was appreciated 😌  A rich, immersive, and achingly heartfelt novel that is superbly written and highly transportive. “Last Night at the Telegraph Club” is to be savored; there is so much depth and detail to it, and the characters and their stories just LEAP off the page and into life. I adored every moment of Lily’s story and will absolutely be rereading and recommending this book to others!   This was very different from what I have thought before reading it... And in the best way possible. I love the telegraph Club and all the lesbian girls in it. The solidarity and friendship between them was perfect. Also I love the history and timeline we get along with the main story.RECOMMENDED 💜  Definitely was anxiety-inducing at times but that's a testament of how realistically things were being depicted and how well-written the book was. I wish I had looked up the trigger warnings though. About the flashbacks, they were kind of a hit or miss for me, I liked them sometimes but not often enough.  I read this because Ann Braden recommended it, and it swept me into another time and place: San Francisco in the 1950s. Lily struggles to figure out how to be true to herself within the confines of her Chinese American family. I especially appreciated the author's note about the historical context and the experience of queer Chinese American women, and Chinese American's during McCarthyism.   i really really really wanted to love this book…but everything just felt so irrelevant to the plot? like the plot was very obviously there but it took us forever to get to it and yeah it was sad but it wasn’t sad for long enough for me to care? idk, i love me a sapphic book anyday of the week, but this one just didn’t do it for me :(  this was so good!! i love everything about this story and i’m so glad it had a happy ending 🫶 everyone should read this book tbh. it’s such good representation of what it was like being lesbian in the 1950s!edit: i’ve nene thinking about this book so much lately and i’ve realized it’s a 5 star book and one of my favorite books/ favorite queer books i’ve ever read   I stan a book set in SF that’s written by a local, not a transplant 🙌🏼 it was so obvious that Lo knows the streets of my city by the bay like the back of her hand. It was so special to vividly visualize the location of each scene. The book itself has a long, drawn out set up, but the last third of the book was exceptional. A great coming of age love story!  2.5 ⭐️⭐️I think the best way to describe this book is underwhelming. I liked the characters and their romance well enough. They had their cute moments, but their personalities, aspirations and lives just felt quite underdeveloped. I found myself skimming through a lot of seemingly unnecessary throwbacks just to get to the good parts.   Naprawdę, nie wiem co tu napisać, by oddać to, jak czuję się po przeczytaniu tej książki. Czytając ją:- uśmiechałam się od ucha do ucha- śmiałam się - machałam nogami na pełnych napięcia momentach ale także:- zaciskałam zęby, w obawie co zaraz się stanie- płakałam- (no i może raz [albo i więcej] miałam ochotę nią rzucić)Mogę ją śmiało polecić innym i jestem pewna, że nie zawiodą się.  I tried the sample and I feel like the author's writing style is not for me. I feel like she is trying too hard to construct a scene and setting and that pulls me out of the story and rather look for how she is doing what annoys me :-/ Not a good match, so I need to pass on this. I was legitimately upset when this book ended, because I wasn't ready to let Lily go. I want to know more about her life and where she goes next! Well rounded characters and good conflicts, and so very sweet. More books like this, please.  I couldn't wait to get it over with: detached writing style, too many street descriptions (killed the vibe), the love interest doesn't have a personality, sugar coated epilogue. The history aspects were interesting but not informative enough for me.  Im obsessed with all these characters. I need a really really long sequel about the rest of the lives of Lily and Kath, I need a book about Tommy and Lana, and I also wouldn’t say no to one about aunt Judy and all the women at Jet Propulsion Lab i loved this so much. the time period was very interesting and i believe accurate as well. at the end it got very interesting and the complexity of the situation in lily’s perspective was portrayed very well.  4,5amazing book i really loved it and felt attached to the characters, the telegraph club but somehow it didn’t make me feel so many things or touched my feelings which is what was missing for meit was reallyyyy good tho, love that it’s a historical fiction about lesbians   Fantastic, nuanced book about a piece of history typically erased. The conflicts between communities and the people who live at their overlaps are so well described. Don't read while doing a medical fast - the descriptions of food are so good and made me so hungry!  I did not love the chapters from other perspectives but it was a good book. I knew shit was going to go down but I really hoped for understanding family members. Sadly, their reaction fits the time period. Top 3 reads of 2021 (at least). There is so much here, deftly handled. Love, friendship, community, tradition. Queer historical YA set in San Francisco in 1954-55, what a rare pleasure to read and cry and then read the research notes.  This was a fast read and hard to put down. The young, forbidden love story compiled with the political and cultural challenges of the time, were complex and likely very similar to things that happened during that time, and even, to some degree, still occur. Def a good read. Lazy ending honestly, she could have done more. But Lo does an incredible job at putting into words the feeling when you love another woman but are unsure of how they feel towards you. The anticipation was incredible.  It's a pretty cute story and I love the cultural aspect of Lily's life, but I didn't get captivated by the story as much as I thought I would, and I couldn't even finish it. It's too bad, and I'll probably try to read it again later, but I expected something else.  Though I’m not one for historical fiction this was essential to know as it shined a light on history that has been hidden as Melinda Lo best puts it, “slipped through the cracks”. The novel follows Lily Hu who all her life has known that the question of liking girls and not boys is a possible reality for her. Though her family and her best friend Shirley (We’re ready to fight Shirley soon 🤺🤺), wish for Lily to marry and meet someone soon, Lilly does not want to. The extents that Shirley tried to set up Lily with their classmate Will is quite insane, WHAT ARE YOU NOT COMPREHENDING SHIRLEY!! But Will is nice of enough to know that Lily does not want to date and so Shirley backs off mainly though cause she’s dating Calvin who’s wait for … a communist and this caused tensions. The FBI and the government have been eager to push their racist agenda and deport millions of those documented and undocumented finding lucrative ways to deport those with documentation, such as Lily’s dad. Her dad who was raided and questioned by the FBI defended Calvin and his communist group lying about Calvin being a communist resulting in the revocation of his identification. Back to Lily! So she enjoys math and science 🧬 while most enjoy boys and dances. Kath Miller, a classmate who’s been in all her classes especially the advanced math classes, starts to hangout with Lily. The two start to bond and realize that they might share similar interests. They get gelato 🍨 and then head to the store where Lily offers to show the book that’s left the question imprinted into her thoughts. But this 🌶 book is gone and so Lily describes it. They’re quick to realize they’re even more similar and so eventually they go to the Telegraph Club. A repeated event that brings them closer together and still separated from the rest of those that attend. Lily is quick to realize that she’s the only Chinese American in the club and faces micro-aggressions from the attendees and performers of the club calling her oriental and china doll face. But the feelings she has for Kath make her her endure the comments and luring, the beer might be helping her too. The book also jumps into the past where we see more of how Lily and her parents and her aunt’s view came to be. For her parents they came to America and were trapped due to the war in China and what occurred in Shanghai and Manchuria. So they continued their purpose of being in America and studied towards achieving their doctorate and degrees so they could work in medicine. Both succeeded but family is what united them to stay. As for the aunt she’s always been supportive of Lily even with her curious interests in stem and exploring the unknown and scary as the aunt herself is a scientist in Pasadena!! Kath has a friend Jean who is a lesbian as well and when she was found out by the school was expelled so the two have kept their secret in hiding till Shirley’s dear Calvin and Will and friends spot Lily running away and leaving her scarf after the club was raided and Kath was separated from her. The breaks and weekends and after school hours had bonded the two together but Shirley was the scissors to the paper. With Shirley running for Miss Chinese American Pageant she required all her friends including Lily who she suspected was hanging out with Beth who had similar rumors that Jean had. Shirley loses and cements her lost when she doesn’t get enough tickets sold and Lily speaks hard cold facts telling Shirley that looks don’t matter to the judge but whoever gets the judges the most money and so Lily informed Shirley what their friends could not. Shirley returns the favor by threatening to tell Lily’s parents about the telegraph club and the male impersonators, and the drinking, the secret romance, Kath, all of it. So Lily speaks up and tells her mom before New Years, her favorite holiday due to the fireworks. But her mom condemns her and says no homosexuals in my family and so Lily runs away to the only one she can think of not arrested, Lana. Lana takes care of but with Tommy the impersonator being released soon and an aggressor to Lily her stay has been met. But Aunt Judy is here to save the day when she finds the address to the place that Lily had written in her notebook. Judy brings Lily home and comes the awakened socializing with family and the avoiding crying in front of her brothers who sense that Lily is in trouble. So when her parents inform Lily that she is leaving Galileo High and going to Pasadena to finish her year out she’s heartbroken. But she accepts that and gives her younger brother the last duty of delivering a letter to Beth’s younger sister. Though the truth of her relationship reached her brothers at school they still love her and I believe that’s what gave her hope to experience the real world outside the walls that the racist society built. She leaves Chinatown and San Francisco for a new life. A year passes and she meets Beth in person both have changed but achieved their goals they first shared in the beginning. Beth now flying planes and Lily becoming a doctor and scientist at UCLA for stem and rockets. A foreshadowing in the last chapters indicated this when Lily read a book that had a sad ending where the protagonists were separated but still thought of each other till their deaths. But overall 5/5 and taught me new history that I’ll share in the instagram post!! despite the slow start, i really did love this book. although i would’ve loved to see more of lily and kath’s relationship and the nuances of their time together after so long together, i thought it was so beautifully written and i rlly enjoyed it &lt;3 i absolutely loved this book. the ambiance, the rep, the historical aspects, specifically life for lily as a chinese-american, queer girl. the book was kinda drawn out at times, but nonetheless it was a stunning portrayal of youth and love and identity &lt;3 4.5🌟This book! What a breath of fresh air. So so so many things I loved about it: historical fiction + coming of age + exploration of the intersection of identities. Not really much more you could want. One word for this novel: genuine.  Achei esse livro mt lindinho, a escritora estudou muito pra escrever essas partes históricas. Amei a principal indo no club, se descobrindo, foi mágico. Achei que as algumas partes meio cansativas, se tirasse umas 100 paginas, acho que eu gostaria mais. FUCKING FUCK OMFG THIS BOOK IS SO GOOD!!!slow burn, friends to lovers, the gay confusion, the drama, the conflict ughhhhhhhhhi rly liked the way the author handled lily's coming out, even tho it killed me. THE ENDING AHHHHH PLEASE A SEQUEL PLEASE!!!  4.5// rtc!  I got the offer to review this book in an email, thanks to NetGalley and was excited that Malinda Lo had a new book coming out (well, it’s already out now). I’ve liked all of her previous books, despite the fact that we see things very differently, politically.A warning for my conservative readers: this is a lesbian coming-of-age story. While it’s not particularly graphic or anything, there’s the usual stuff you’d expect of a young adult romance novel.Anyway, this is the story of Lily Hu, a Chinese girl living in ’50s San Francisco. She lives in Chinatown with her parents and two brothers. She’s seventeen and in her senior year of high school, and after discovering male impersonator Tommy Andrews in a newspaper, she ends up seeing her schoolmate Kathleen Miller (‘Kath’ for short) in a whole new light. She realizes she’s gay, and soon discovers that Kath is gay too, but before that, they begin making clandestine nighttime trips to a lesbian club called The Telegraph Club, where Tommy Andrews performs.When I started this novel, I knew the author had done a lot of research into the time period and the gay culture of San Francisco, and it all came alive for me. It was fascinating, since I’m from the Bay Area (further up north, in Solano county). Life for Lily and her community isn’t easy, because of the hysteria surrounding communism and the fact that these were the early years of the Cold War. The authorities were suspicious of Chinese immigrants due to the fact that in this timeframe, China fell to Mao Zedong’s Communist Party. Lily’s Shanghai-born father, Joseph, a doctor at the Chinese Hospital, has his papers confiscated once he refused to divulge the communist ties of one of his patients and Lily’s schoolmate Calvin. This happens even though he’s a veteran of World War 2.Yes, things were tough for non-white people back then, even though it was San Francisco and not, say, Montgomery, Alabama. The author does not shy away from using the terms people used back then, such as “oriental” and “negro”. Lily and her friends also encounter casual racism, but it’s not as horrible as what blacks would encounter in the Deep South. Still, I find myself deeply grateful that the US isn’t like that anymore. Given how the media keeps whipping up hysteria about racism, I feel that teen readers of this book will not appreciate how much things have truly changed.Being suspected of communist sympathies is bad enough – even her Chinese relatives and friends are completely disgusted by homosexuality. Lily ends up feeling like an outcast because of these two things, but navigates them with strength and grace.I actually liked the scenes at the Telegraph Club, as the club was a safe haven for the women who could not be themselves out in public, could not express their love for each other the way heterosexual couples could. It also reminded me of another novel – Tipping the Velvet by Sarah Waters, which also features a male impersonator.The novel is mostly told in the third-person perspective, from Lily’s perspective, but there’s also several chapters in between the different parts of the novel, all told from the perspectives of her father, mother and aunt Judy when they were younger. It is through these chapters that we see how Lily’s parents got together, and we also see, through Judy’s eyes, Lily’s budding interest in aeronautics and sci-fi. I loved that aspect about Lily – I love sci-fi too, and I also love astronomy.There’s also a lot about Chinese culture, from the dress to the food to the history and language, and there’s some lines of dialogue in Chinese characters, but they’re translated in footnotes. Some other terms are romanized, but translated in footnotes.As noted, the novel is separated into several parts, and in between those parts are the chapters told from her parents and aunt’s point of view, and a timeline of important historical events from that time period. I was afraid the author would be sympathetic to communism and such, but it isn’t that big a part of the novel. Plenty of Lily’s family and friends are definitely not fond of communism, and some are resentful of being suspected of communist sympathies or ties due to their nationality and/or ethnicity, which is understandable.The romance between Lily and Kath is a slow one, and the true romance happens much later in the novel. I kind of wish it had happened sooner, as the novel felt really long, but then we probably wouldn’t have those alternate chapters, which I also found fascinating.Things go fine at the Telegraph Club until the police raid the place and arrest the owner and Tommy Andrews. Even though homosexuals were allowed to legally gather at the time, the club owner and patrons were suspected of luring underage teenagers to the club, where they supposedly plied them with alcohol and drugs. After that happens, Lily eventually comes out to her parents, and at the risk of offering spoilers, let’s just say it does not go well.The end is kind of sad and bittersweet, although I’ll spoil it a little bit by saying that Lily and Kath do have a happy ending. It’s kind of anti-climactic, but they do have a happy ending.Anyway, I wasn’t sure if I was going to like this one, but I ended up enjoying it, especially getting a view into Chinese culture, which, like Japanese and Korean culture, fascinates me.The very end of the book contains a lengthy author’s note adding context to the story by discussing the history of the era and the research she did. It’s also pretty fascinating, and the author even disclosed that certain people in her family were inspiration for elements of the story.It’s pretty good, not only for learning about the Chinese immigrant community of the ’50s but also for the challenges lesbians faced at that time.Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for providing me with this ARC for review.Originally published at http://bookreviews.elainemarias.com/?...  ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh this was so good. malinda lo never fucking misses  This book is featured in my booktube video:
