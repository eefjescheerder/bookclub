Abby Stein ’ book , Becoming Eve , exemplifies pitfalls genre OTD memoir . Her story differentiates , Abby trans woman , story “ transitions. ” Each Abby ’ transitions intensified , especially happened early twenties , shortly Abby ’ arranged marriage birth . But dominant story Abby ’ chafing rebelling Hasidic Williamsburg community . She rebels faith . She rebels teachers school rules . She reads forbidden books . She engages taboo sexual tryst yeshiva classmate . And recounts rebellion rigid gender norms expectations perform manhood—she refused long hair shorn payos turned wanted long hair , angry argument father time bar mitzvah .

The narrative arc : We , ex-Hasidim , born world suppressed , engaged bizarre ritual eye-popping customs . Despite , special , different rest , remain passive . We fought freedom odds .

The book 's tone hopeful positive , 's , refreshing kind memoir . As Abby , continued ! I hope writes books life Torah . Reading reviews , I complaints Abby skips number years , coming present day . I 's important remember ( readers ) entitled event life . It makes complete share details -- especially -- privacy protect . Furthermore , events n't sharing painful . Or , simply , detail life public consumption , deeper reason . And , fact , I embrace omissions , make things share meaningful . Stein incredibly detailed upbringing , assigned male birth historical rabbinic family New York Hasidic community . I appreciated reflections stifling repressive context , attention paid loved nourished growing up.There challenging aspects portions story related gender . One , fought twenties , reports early 2 3 years part girl . That early binary certainty simply foreign existence , I bristle broad room made kinds trans narratives exclusion . The challenging part 25 pages book leaves Hasidic community , learns word transgender lives woman . While story course , tough life fit poorly , rush peace found . My experience feels especially abrupt unfinished relationship beloved completely unmentioned unaddressed transitions.It 's easy read , labor love , bit dry . I , I spirits lifted I 'm glad . A interesting memoir growing rabbinic `` royalty '' Hasidic community feeling estranged 's body strict gender socialization community . It 's fascinating inside closed community , Stein writer make world alive.However , Stein 's memoir life inside community , means I intrigued -- decision leave community , GED start secular education , supported financially , . -- barely mentioned paragraph . There memoirs covered material , Stein n't include , I 'd grown interested person I wanted hear specific experiences.Also , I n't wonder role hyper-separate gender roles Hasidism played Stein 's gender struggles . She talks bit gender social construct gender dysphoria , I hear reflection body binary world . Maybe 's reflection book ! The story compelling , scattered . The felt hurried , genuine . Very interesting read . Amazing ! ! ! ! ! I ’ back review , I put fantastic book . Definitely top read 2020 . The direct heiress founder ultra-orthodox Jewish movement , Hasidism , aware childhood woman born body . After birth , leaves deeply conservative community undergoes transition . Unfortunately , autobiography huge potential ended literary Ted Talk . Abby Stein 's Hasidic community New York - Hasidic communities world - conservative . Very conservative . In 21st century Brooklyn , manner late 18th century Eastern Europeans , Hasidism originated . Their world admirably impenetrable . For , residents speak English . Schools teach English , . Students devote time religious texts Jewish law . After , everyday life full rules . A strongly religious society , , extremely gendered . Smarter families devote lives God law , business functioning community general . Women give birth children , huge families chaste possible .

But vast majority connected especially childhood . The author conceived autobiography space preserving childhood memories diary reconciliation family , remember love . The dilemmas early adulthood associated dating transitioning barely addressed . At time , I I blame book promise . Abby teases exit beginning , frequently references grown-up , `` , '' definitely afraid cliffhangers chapters . We follow youth eighty percent book . We learn times exceptional student , time - - rebel , finally landed school . Her rebellion different . From particularly astute questioning foundations faith community , reading forbidden books , inventing special paper bombs supposedly smell shit soaked coffee solution leave traces appropriate shade . Most time , interpretation chronological , abundantly interspersed stories facts life community , family , difficult-to-process tracing family trees . Stein taste important aforementioned clannishness , , aunt married person 's brother - means . The detailed rendering 's life surroundings ends time wedding . That , age eighteen , decision happen begins mature , hyper-diligent studies faith God reduce feeling gender dysphoria . But point , finished biopic . Only subtitles telegraphically summarizing life character running . Completion rabbinical studies . Birth . Getting Internet . Googling organization helping leave Hasidic community . An unhappy session uncomprehending father progressive rabbi . Thanks organization . Taking social networks , wave reactions requests interviews . So . Nevertheless , reader , I felt sorry mentioned event space fact ten twelve siblings stopped communicating . Likewise father mother , strong relationship . We n't turned wife . I doubt public support unimaginable boost years crippling doubt . Precisely unimaginability , I interested coped public interest . Likewise condemnation family hand . As critical assessment majority society prism values ​​that remained extent . However , Stein offer problem-free happy-end catchy music . Then . The book literary weak . I find biggest craft problem passage , introduced teachers . “ When Stein student engaged , study hall flames ’ faze . But Stein ’ mood , do. ” A Abby Stein dodává : „ I ’ descriptions character I heard “ . But 's writing works . English writers classic editorial message Show , n't . This young journo kicks report words summarizing `` authorities throwing problem hot potato '' instead describing throwing potato , flies , hot , short , action . That 's Abby Stein time . We learn lot , concrete manifestations reader make interpretation character , . We scripts life Hasidic community family , Stein offer illustrated experience sporadically .

Everything turned , , 's applaud . Prospect magazine named author fifty influential thinkers 2020 . Hopefully . For , talks exceptional . I fascinated courage Abby . I wanted hear story liberation freedom finally woman knew . Unfortunately story missed mark . I wanted ! I wanted share feelings day stepped Abby . I wanted hear experiences family woman transitioning . Becoming Eve ’ foray reading stories left ultra orthodoxy , I Jewish woman raised primarily secular interfaith/agnostic family . As gently I , I ’ I finished book I ’ Jewish . While I understand necessity list family relationships understanding book , awhile I found focusing related action story . What engaged reading story specifically Jewish child , Judaism , especially Ultra-Orthodox Judaism , impacted relationship gender sex . In relationship Judaism I analyzed , questioned lamented women treated , sought spaces feel included services . I enjoyed reading familial structure familial culture different families dynasties large Chassidic umbrella . The idiosyncrasies separate family fitting tight constructs interesting , especially share religion . Still I ’ engaged I I ’ Jewish . My truest gripe Becoming Eve ending , left unsatisfied unfulfilled . The action consistently moving forward pretty linear birth , drop jarring . I completely understand desire necessity withholding information ( I ’ watched Abby interviews fervently defend ’ privacy , I applaud respect ) , pace story needed tapering past handful pages . A book ’ tight timeline probably afforded kind abrupt finish . Reading epilogue ( acknowledgments ) time lost , chronological telling I felt unfulfilled . I blame editor personally ; ’ absolutely slowly book , protect identities leave room book . But “ ” sentiment . I ’ editor , reason choice , ’ taste . I book stands “ OTD ” stories , added layer gender identity , Abby great job letting reader risk feelings . Leaving community , transitioning added “ offense , ” lack word . I away Becoming Eve , feeling sympathy empathy sisterhood . And Jews Abby , ’ escape insular communities born . Her bravery commendable I ’ thankful read story . I ’ helped , Jewish , step truest . Amazing , amazing book . I love writing style . It 's catching friend coffee . A casual accessible treatment difficult childhood . I 'm grateful found Jewish community accepting , celebrates trans Jews , including trans rabbi . So 's important reminded , unfortunately , universal attitude trans Jews accepted .

Then , content books type I read year specifically individuals deciding break free Hasidic Judaism . I memoir kick . This I 'd hearing/reading lot : lists , podcasts , etc. , 's makes admire courageous writer . Near book , Stein writes story `` happening '' ; text 's final sentence `` To continued !

Very interesting.Learned lot history customs Hasidic Jewish community.Written great detail honesty story woman ’ decision forever change life . Abby Stein shares story generously vulnerably . As queer Jewish person , I found books I felt reflect identities aptly . This book hard put , I miss reading ! Quite possibly , books I read ! A gripping story spans lifetime uncertainty , Abby break free Hassidic community . The 's kind , Abby Stein recounts experience born heir long dynasty ultra-orthodox Hasidic rabbis descended directly Bal Shem Tov virtually eliminated understanding compassion parents Stein ’ personal identity struggles.Abby Chava Stein born Yisroel Avrom Ben Menachem Mendel 1991 Brooklyn , New York . Stein 13 children . It captures story growing fitting , brothers , wanting feminine sisters , struggling find place Yeshiva . She rebelled express feelings individuality community place , despite modern , liberal diverse cities world , trapped insular society cultural norms honoured traditions dating back 18th century life country.I found irony fact Abby born Jewish family blocks lived , story remarkable . But juxtaposition , Kabbalah explained , feminine soul re-incarnated boys body Hasidic American shtetl . Her attempts rebel allowed encouraged father higher thinkers Jewish Rabbinic studies teach questions , push back , critique scripture interpretations Torah . All , home , school strict code rules conduct highly gender-specific , questions lack faith encouraged rebellious highest order inquisitive mind , question , seek truth find answers.Even language Yiddish dark , feelings felt vocabulary language . She pushing pushing learn , learning read Hebrew exploring text find give possible explanation.In , Yeshiva Talmudic teachers allowed start learn Kabbalah Jewish mysticism , traditionally reserved elder married . Abby found rational explanations ( context upbringing ) feelings , explain family.This book answered questions Judaism survived long thrived despite rigid rules society oppression . There permissiveness book touches , rebel , questions , seek answers , ( Rabbi 's ) opinion . This encouraged culture.Ultimately , struggle , I Abby honoured gave strength encouraged push forward find answers badmouthing from.Notable highlights : I loved Yiddish vocabulary I learned book religious family org chart paints Rebbes descendants Baal Shem Tov . This text explores modern-day themes diversity ( inclusion ) search explanation , Abby navigated culture religion structure essentially expert Hasidim explained book.Having grown modern conservadox family visited communities Abby , Williamsburg , NY , The Catskills religious summer camps , I recognized scenes described . There lot familiarity traditions described context entirely different perspective , Mikveh ritual.Interesting things I learned Takeaways : What I book I felt neutral terms judgmental cast blame upbringing experience . It felt oppressed pained . It factual painted clear picture I imagine homosexual probably feel inside heads young age rationalize thoughts environment cultural norms . Abby experience knowing feelings , label attached , exploring reading learning questioning deep resources feel belonged explain others.What I find explanations answers confines strict culture lived , Kabbalah , perfectly acceptable place rationalization feelings connect family . I love Judaism answers , n't regular life community , found tribe accepted family , city.Maybe literally 12 tribes Israel , different versions Judaism played world , closely aligned Hasidim , call Jews . It enduring rigidity flexibility allowed survive years stuck . We find matter book gave hope path n't belong community . If Jewish group Jews accept you.What I read ? Anti-Semitism Bari Weiss RTC ! Fascinating subject material , great book - focuses great deal author 's childhood , education marriage , interesting , oddly spends couple paragraphs transition , despite concept title book . Abby ’ story familiar strange time.Abby grew community , experienced life events , , all. & nbsp ; I ’ expect I started reading . I expected OTD book , read transgender book , knew different.I expect narcissistic , Abby ’ Facebook wall indicator.Instead I found coming age story . The typical OTD narrative .

You ’ make shit sound smart ) , Or Kugelech ( similar jacks ) called `` Kokelech '' described juggling game . This editorial mistake.The narcissism smart probably 30 40 times book . Why ’ story smart , instead telling smart ? & nbsp ; Anyway , moving away author , story , I share feelings book , particular review I read.Frieda Vizel wrote lovely review ( https : //friedavizel.com/2019/12/11/be ... ) resonated ways , personally.A friend felt Frieda mocking OTD experience . I ’ feel true.You hold experiences stay feelings place , mock other. & nbsp ; At review , Frieda writes : “ The real missed opportunity , exploration toxic gender-segregated world ’ conform rigid male female dichotomies . A book raised woman perfect opportunity close . `` & nbsp ; & nbsp ; But missed opportunity ? Abby chooses share story ways meaningful her. & nbsp ; The gap , , . There question asked , book written exploration toxic gender-segregated world ’ conform rigid male/female dichotomies.Writers- note ! Abby Stein 's life story interesting , I find interesting wrote structured memoir . Some reviewers criticized spends lot time describing intricate details method religious study , I personally big impact life deserves space give . I agree feels skipped important details , especially nearing book talking exit Hasidic community , , I understand coming withholds details n't fully `` '' share world publicize . The writing style amazing , considering Stein learnt English language recently , I n't consider fatal flaw . Also , listening audiobook read author makes negligible detail opinion . odd # 2 Imagine transgender part fundamentalist religious community gender roles deeply engrained - n't gender dysphoria exists . This Stein 's story left Hasidic world transgender ; 's unaware memoir combines experiences . I gave stars ; I enjoyed . The topic fascinating , Stein describes . But describes connected , eyes glazed ; I n't straight . It weird refers mother `` Mommy '' - adult . I n't typical Hasidim . While personal story , Stein glosses things , jumping ahead lot . Did parents decide speak ? That 's impression I , n't spelled . How wife transgender , Fraidy deal ? Does Stein ? How long learn English ? Etc . ETA : I spent time online .

( Modern Hebrew . ) I found translations made , author books Richard Dawkins s/he accessed internet story ? This absolutely massive book . I picked library started Shabbat coming , finished out.It 's easy read interesting.Verdict : I book library , I calculate money I read ..... I 's worth $ 10 . I listened book audiobook , heard Abby Stein episode This American Life . On TAL told story watching sister 's wedding fence , I immediately struck emotional eloquence . It affected deeply hear describe mother 'living ghost ' cut family . When mentioned Abby written book experience I knew I hear it.In description trans experience book reminded great deal Conundrum Jan Morris - Morris , grown 1930s 40s , equally unaware world Abby , growing Hasidic community Brooklyn 1990s 2000s.What struck Abby , world 's conformist communities , deep level .

It joyful hear discover felt precedent . Reading life Hasidic community conflicting feelings . I admit , walked past Hasidim London read custody battles newspapers , I listened tourist-like curiosity Hasidic life . At , felt . Abby 's description battle parents ' families colour stockings worn women parents ' wedding sounded farcical . And I heard , I n't feel discussions modesty , women wear , petty status games humans play , ( worse ) universal . How things fight sound ridiculous Hasidim ? Sometimes I amazed strictures Hasidic life , I exchange stifling conformity , kind security life . The siblings extended families , rituals spirituality - particular knowledge n't , higher authority appeal . I point Abby outsiders understand comfort Rebbe advice emergency . I sympathise I 'm uncertain world too.These intertwined narratives , gaining trans identity whilst losing community , universal thread - tension life , relationships turns nurturing restrictive.Abby 's book fantastic moving work autobiography , I thankful time emotional labour share story world . I hope read topics - I interesting thoughts share . Keeping mind I coming goyish perspective ... I book . I surprised Abby n't spoiled , growing `` prince '' Hasidim , descended lines important rebbes . When appeared boy , received silk robe age , Hasidic receive garment adult . She offered fur young age , , mother wearing fur white stockings looked young boy much.Abby smart , rebellious . Sometimes concentrate study hard tween , lot trouble torment teachers . Her parents felt existential made act , n't gender dysphoria . Abby n't start words feelings late teens . She learned gender social construct , reflected Hasidic communities Williamsburg , Brooklyn intense gender roles , repressed sexuality . Young Hasidim sheltered married , late teens.Abby found support group called Footsteps helps ultra-orthodox Jews leave lifestyle learn modern world secular culture , including learning English . Most family stopped speaking explained father woman , 'd . Abby attending Columbia University , lot support students professors , friends 'd made secular world.There 's gap time 's circumcision Abby 's settled life trans woman . She mentions divorced wife , turbulent time brushed comment . Another reviewer notes Abby n't supposed talk legal issues time , including custody . Abby mention great love wishing wonderful life.Abby work hard fair parents narrative . They loved , grew rebellious struggled sensed existential issue . When Abby reveals existential issue 's transgender , 's , child loving kind been.Another caveat I 'm coming cis-gender perspective . From perspective doubly outsider , I . Other personal experience gender issues growing insular religious society authority judge content view Abby 's life . This Abby ’ story raised boy Hasidic community Williamsburg , New Jersey , feeling intensely girl . Born Hasidic “ royalty ” eldest family twelve siblings , assumed religious leader community . Her story boy rebelling constraints ultra Orthodox Jewish beliefs , coming female society ’ understand , approve , transgender . To leave community questioning religious beliefs vanquish family home town ; transgender raised banishment level.As story boy ’ rebellion Hasidic culture traditions , interesting story . It told fairly , lot names thrown made hard follow times ( especially I ’ Jewish names terminology unfamiliar ) . I ’ read couple memoirs women leaving Hasidic faith , . Oddly , drew memoir ( fact realizes ’ female leaves community order live life woman ) kind secondary questioning faith . For 90 % book , gender ’ matter : male female , I rebelled strict religious upbringing . Although bringing gender story , ’ tackles issue head . Fair : sheltered community ’ internet , science books , intermingling sexes . But finally break free seeks life woman , happen quickly suddenly story ended . I questions left unanswered : cope emotionally transitioned ? Her parents refuse meet , talk phone ... mother ’ thoughts ? What wife ( divorced ) child ? How broach subject wife told leaving ... transitioning ? I ’ , I feel questions left unanswered , left hole story supposed about.Nevertheless , interesting life Hasidic community , unique view culture/religion male female perspective firsthand.3.5 stars I absolutely loved time book , despite moments discomfort moments rage antiquated practices talked religious upbringing . I personally real religion life questions I logically answered , I prove disprove God . Nor I prove disprove change 's opinion.My absolute favorite part book , raw emotion , story told . This n't written lot non-fiction written . The chapters n't 40-50 page , short novellas felt trudging mud point . I believe longest chapter 10 pages , chapter told piece story perfectly way.As cis gender heterosexual male , I n't relate struggles author growing , big part I wanted read book . As faced struggles , I feel book great job expressing deep confusing struggles growing . I back moments childhood sort struggles growing , friend hitting puberty awkward , I imagining awkward struggle I raised boy , boys body , knowing deep I girl . Despite relate based personal life experiences , I Abby fantastic job explaining felt , I imagine scenario I feel . Dealing Abby strong confident , huge support system story , shows level strength I n't I personally possess.I learned lot Judaism Ultra-Orthadox Hasidic Jewish culture I probably I put time reading book . I n't understand lot , surrounding oneself faith making lives n't harming , cares I n't understand it.Thank Abby sharing story struggles . I personally learned lot I hoping learn I picked book . Ca n't wait rest story unfold ! This book I ’ read woman growing insular community , memoir woman leaving insular community beginning transition . There themes I recognized Tara Westover ’ Educated Kate Bornstein ’ A Queer Pleasant Danger . But timing organization book left questions.Abby Stein great detail childhood Hasidic Williamsburg consistently nails home point girl childhood . It thread ran upbringing life discovery.She heavy lifting explaining religious customs secular audience . She spends large amount time details Hasidic holidays , rituals , daily norms . But I feel I away learning Hasidism Abby.She finally leaves community chapter book , ’ find . She credits nonprofit Footsteps helping , ’ walk process leaving . Who ? What step ? How decide enroll Columbia ? What studying ? And , I : relationship Judaism today ? After leaving Hasidism , Abby takes years find coming family . This ’ touched epilogue book ! I ’ book ! ! And , I questions left unanswered . How coming change relationships ? Who family speak ? Does relationship ex-wife ? Her ? ? How choose ? What physical changes accompanying hormone replacement therapy ? These fundamental questions I memoir.Ultimately , I offer grace Abby . She ’ young- 30 book published- English language , learned pretty recently . The writing simple felt unsophisticated , helpful , explanatory , conversational . It felt friend sharing stories , especially anecdotal . I wish filled color story . A transgender woman leave Hasidic community , idea transgender tightly proscribed gender roles community n't mix well.Like Unorthodox Deborah Feldman , Abby Stein give inside view gender constrained Hasidic community Brooklyn . She immense complication transgender , born 'son ' rabbinic family . She aware inside gender long time , struggled male expectations family community , wanting female side process . She job conveying frustration , community 's strict self-isolation made unaware transgender exists personal issue.I dear church member transgender woman recently transitioned . She alive spring step , transition . Not life , Abby . I greater understanding friend reading Becoming Eve . I parallels Black Lives Matter movement . The societal view gays I growing horrific , understanding LGBTQ spectrum . I hope learned LGBTQ , . I learning color short changed societal training , acknowledge participated injustice actively . Whether call children God fellow citizens , , casual death color hands police supposed protect serve , protect serve . I listening learning . I wanted LOVE book . I wanted give 5 stars give glowing review hold great memoir combines psychological & amp ; sociological interests -- leaving ultra-religious upbringings gender transition.Another review site book Stein 's Off Derech ( OTD ) transition . For book , I disagreed ; book Stein 's realization gender identity rebellion Hasidic Judaism result realization . Her gender confusion drove OTD . This I knew , heard speak reading previously , I previous reviewer wrong.But Stein reaches point story learns transgenderism applies label , book ends . There scene father , description camping trip Yom Kippur ( description speeches ) , . No exploration identity , description struggling beliefs ... And I : difficult subject , Stein wrote book , unlike rest life , n't lot time reflect . But part journey , claim book transition , skip transition , bit misleading.I hope Stein eventually writes book process community , divorce , transition , finding Judaism . I definitely read . But book , heat-wrenching , book I I 'd reading . SO GOOD . SO INTRESTING . SO PERSONAL . I recommend ! ! ! As secular Jewish israeli-american queer girl , hearing deep dive aspects jewish community I thrilling . The author managed raw express love hate ultra-Orthodox Judism reflects views giving reader room form opinion . Abby Stein , 're reading , 're amazing ! ! Would 5 stars fact immediate high finishing book , I realized lot biggest questions remained unanswered . I recognize memoir , authors personal choice details include emit narrative , book framed journey leaving hasidic community living openly trans woman , book completely skip part journey . She explains length family history childhood part `` realize '' `` leave 've , including family '' brushed briefly epilogue ... It , course , choice personal details include ( especially considering fact recent fresh ) understandable ... bit hollow ending incredible book . ( Other things subtract bit wonky editing times clunky language -- easily chalked english language big deal . ) Abby 's book brave inspirational , Jews , queer , queer Jews ( ! ) .She writes detail secretive life led Hasidic New York City , revealing practices , traditions reality lives . As secular Jew , I found difficult judge things writes , rampant abuse withholding knowledge masses leaders . I past religious journey understand Abby brought , beauty addition pain.I particularly enjoyed reading Abby 's struggle freedom passion reading learning , love shared boy yeshiva . In , memoir read work fiction , young heroine struggling find repressive upbringing.My wish Abby written transition , transgender woman Hasidic Jew leaving community . It felt entire `` chapter '' life ( book ) missing , I hope means intends write sequel eventually . I room introspective reflection events experienced , attempt make things happened hindsight , I surprised common book.All , must-read LGBTQ+ Jews curious Hasidic life . Who fail intrigued description book ? Unfortunately , n't deliver promise.Yes , person account dedicated , bright , ultra-orthodox student , studying rabbi , inside HE meant SHE . But 's NOT turmoil student disruption school -- unhappy boy act . The book world study , gender roles , traditional rules Hassidic Judaism transgender . You 'll find focus information differences Hassidic sects `` royalty '' , educational options , social religious rituals , marriage rites transgender issue . And point author decides finally `` '' friends family , 's covered quickly detail depth I expected . The book particularly well-written . Granted author limited educational experience English college . But I expected editor helped add polish . On side , 're interested subject matter , 's relatively short book . 4.5 rounded . One I explain transgendered memoir I 've read . Since I personally felt wish different gender ( I birthing babies ! ) I understood internal struggle transgendered person feels . Nor I understand - physically , spiritually , emotionally . I 'm observant person I believe I 'm spiritual idea souls gender settled . I read husband lines book souls genders enter wrong body . Both husband I sat long , transforming . We open minded , n't understand . Which learn . Gendered souls entering wrong body . That understand . I understand . I book missing 100 pages ? We great in-depth 20 years Eve married , kid book ends . I understand wedding ceremony , great relationship wife , ? And 's relationship ? Am I waiting part ? Repetitive . There worth read book . Perhaps , historical information formation Williamsburg enclave . I understand struggles young man/woman life , writer . Unfortunately , I find book library , I audible version narrator , Abby , read book mannerism caricaturesque.And yin yan , fortunately , I buy book , sentence lyrical , I wish I read , inspiring . This told childish words , man/woman relates story upbringing calling mom dad Tatty , Mammy time passes , adult , continues talk childish , irritating voice . If worth read , historical perspective Hassidim New York chapters . There written book transgender . This . If escaping/living strict religious community I find book fictional A complicated Kindness Miriam Towes . Beautifully written , masterpiece today . A memoir born Hasidic Family living twelve siblings . Although male felt female aspect . His spirit female . These feelings female years . Whenever played toys dolls preferred trucks . He suppress feelings twenty years . He Bar Mitzvah wanted Bat Mitzvah . He married child wished wife pregnant delivering baby . Until courage Internet , research finally trans ! He started process female hormones , lost family started education Columbia University ! Its fascinating story . We religious life great detail affect decision leave Hasidic world family affected . There amazing pouring support trans community ! It brave risk , n't suppressing longer . A great read ! This book bit disappointing , especially built reviews . Most - Stein writer , 's extra impressive English n't language . I enjoyed learning ins-and-outs Hasidic world , helped I knew lot terminology n't problem . The real issue book pre-transition childhood . She incredible detail marriage birth , skips ahead years time 's divorced wife , moved away , GED enrolled Columbia , started living woman , began medically transitioning father , speaks . Seeing book pitched memoir life trans person , transitioning part big part narrative . I understand 's free write book obligation reveal part life , I publicity department Seal Press wrote marketing material misleading . I ’ Abby Stein multiple times Rabbi ’ services I biased I phenomenal . This book written place self-care love ’ easily written hate . It Abby younger , heart , ’ normal , ’ , ’ . It pain , I imagine pain ’ written pages , theme incredible resilience . This book spoke extreme pertinent personal level- I ’ Haredi , queer Jew , finding Judaism , back Kabbalah , navigating space choosing occupy intentional pluralistic spaces.Agree criticism parts crucial story left out/glossed over- , ’ autobiography . She ’ obligation share private painful parts I felt plenty shared book . It interesting read . As Jew , I bit ultra-Orthodox communities fascinated read details lived life . I imagine feel believe teaching different gender , foreign concept community . I interested story leaving community transition part , I agree reviewers lot left - divorce , process transitioning , Columbia , . ( I interview keeping mum , story wishes 18 . ) I interested reading faring world . As side note , tidbit stuck lifestyle stockings . A marriage match n't happen n't agree color stockings bride-to-be wear married ! That level detail control life astounds ! The title pretty misleading represents 10 % book 's content . It 's boy rebels orthodoxy , occasional statement `` I 'm girl , ... '' thrown , remind gender identity issues atheism theistic mysticism.I expecting learn gender identity experience author - specific thoughts feelings drove , sustained generally represented author 's gender dysphoria.But I received instance spiteful penis poking , moments author expressed desire woman , repetition `` I am/was girl '' `` The fact I am/was girl '' book . This , , support 's claim 're woman - definition term provided point book.P.s . audioversion book bit hard listen , author accent , slight speech impediment squeakish voice tone . Stein fascinating story - 'coming ' stories . One leaving ultra-religious Hasidic home community , coming transgender.Becoming Eve deals storyline . Of Stein 's struggles religion dealing rigid gender stereotypes Hasidic community affected related religion . Again , fascinating story read , told , Stein n't memoirist stilted repetitive . I 'm story n't Stein . I forward continuing read journey . I recommend enjoy reading secretive religious communities , n't expect earth shattering story writing . I found Abby ’ story compelling I fascinated details early life . I uncomfortable skin , ’ put parents , siblings community . While reading , I skip lot details , especially names . I understand ’ important include , gave full picture big intertwined extended families , detail I found referencing back skipping bits names . I felt I parts story . I especially missing part marriage , I ’ curious relationship wife time conversation leaving community . I understand part memoir probably left family ’ privacy , leave wanting . Overall , I recommend compelling read . As Orthodox Judaism adult , I found book interesting . I read personal account leaving chassidic community . Having Ms. Stein detail upbringing fascinating . The bulk book focuses Ms. Stein 's formative years : childhood marriage . * * Spoiler * * There material actual transition . Just life lead . This personal account . Due circumstances , ( Orthodox Jewish community member 'off derech ' , ceases religious/as religious , shunned ; definitely openly LGBQT ) insight 's opinion perception.Overall I important book read interested LGBQT Jews and/or segments Jewish community deal ( fail deal ) issue . This absolutely unique story ultra orthodox Jewish woman born male , eventually leaves community transitions woman . I fascinated learn cultures ways life , reform Jew , laws customs ultra Orthodox Jews particularly interesting . They bit familiar completely foreign . Abby strong , smart passionate woman ’ incredible make transition.I felt book missing bit detail Abby ’ actual transitions Judaism woman . Most book focuses life experience growing Ultra Orthodox Jewish community . Hopefully write sequel.This story needed told , I ’ glad I read . This memoir , written former Ultra Orthodox family descended holiest Orthodox rabbis world , describes wrong body . Even 3 years age , knew supposed girl , growing Ultra Orthodox community made impossible . Throughout life , 20s , struggled sexual identity , knowing felt . After married child realized transition community female.Very simply told , fast-reading book extremely interesting . It made tied identities break away , point speaking children again.The book concluded quickly I felt , I reading . The memoirs common glance . Yet , underlying authors ’ different lives similar theme : adjust major life change . In “ Becoming Eve : My Journey From Ultra-Orthodox Rabbi Transgendered Woman ” ( Seal Press ) , Abby Chava Stein discusses left Orthodox Judaism , decided transition gender . Jason B. Rosenthal , blindsided wife , Amy Krause Rosenthal , died ovarian cancer , writes difficulty adjusting loss soulmate “ My Wife Said You May Want Marry Me ” ( Harper ) .See rest review https : //www.thereportergroup.org/past ... I enjoyed book , I OTD genre I read combines OTD struggle issues gender identity . My criticism I felt story ended abruptly . Abby meets Tati supportive Rabbi , dad struggling ( ? ) accomodate information gender identity , 'll talk Rabbi decide mother . And 's story 's Epilogue . I wanted hear Abby navigated/navigates relationship family community . ( heartbreaking part , , All Who Go Do Not Return Shulem Deen ) . Everyone 's story different n't read , I longing info . I read book yesterday -- -Trans Day Visibility -- -but I finished afternoon . It 's well-written memoir , Abby Stein definitely life worth reading . That , 's worth noting entirely focuses life growing Hasidic community Brooklyn , dozen pages discuss life discovered existence word `` transgender '' started consider leaving community transitioning . I interested read process leaving community coming , realize needed . Wow , story ! This perfect intersectional issues life . Not Abby grow expectation rabbi ultra-orthodox Jewish community , realizes early age identifies girl ( despite parents community ) . I n't imagine , I 'm proud loving , understanding , empathetic , experiences life , young age.I book narrated frank honest , explaining aspects community unknown outsiders . I found easy empathize , life n't relate . A captivating story ! I read powerful biography sitting Shabbat . Stein tells story 's real , close losing religion , finds solace companionship understanding community Jews open accepting . She portrays Hasidic community 's beautiful celebrations family connections , ugly rejection n't fit . It closed religious community belief system , Williamsburg Wyoming Iran.All communities multi-faceted multi-layered , kudos Stein telling story love appreciation , left , life 's created . Heartfelt story beautiful journeyWhen I started reading book I ’ expect . But I read I realized hard journey author . She dealt feelings woman instead , change life giving history upbringing . I bit disappointed 90 % book dealt explaining Hasidic community laws rituals . I suppose ’ find interesting extreme . I wanted depth Eve handled change . I felt ’ learn . Perhaps sequel book . # threestars # becomingeve Found hard put . Things I expect love : 1 ) memoirs trans experience , 2 ) religious memoirs , 3 ) coming age memoirs . It exceeded expectations.Many books Hasidism written strong anti- pro- perspective lot balanced . This author loving family childhood inextricable religious upbringing , religious upbringing harmful . Both shown . And morally centered , self-aware , ... emotionally generous I phrase . Partly honest self-critical failings , beating them.I enjoyed reading book . So glad . I learned lot customs Hasidic Jews book , I admire Abby 's bravery finding . Her transition story n't told , part book titled `` Becoming Eve . '' I feeling rest story planning told . I struck admission felt girl young age , despite born society extremely distinctive male/female expectations . LGBTQ naysayers tend point mainstream society corrupting young minds . That wasn't/could n't case Abby . This super quick read . It tend jump bit , story powerful written . This absolutely remarkable memoir . I listened audiobook version ( narrated author ) difficult time putting book I move things . There things I wish covered completely skipped , things DID talk , I respect privacy involved . It 's tough publish memoir key alive . So , I loved lot spouse ( i.e . chances re-marrying harmed ? ) ( happen matched + married ? ) things discussed . Again , , remarkable book . feels wrong rate deeply personal memoir , ’ . enjoyed stories abby ’ early life , learned things hasidic judaism , felt life ’ delved . ’ strange details abby ’ actual transition ultra-orthodoxy transition womanhood largely left narrative , despite events book marketed . day , ’ memoir , course chooses share leave . reader felt gaps story , left wanting bit . This memoir fascinating topic left feeling . I reason author skipped painful emotional parts story . The book supposed journey Hasidic transgender woman . However , exodus community transition woman glossed sentences . The majority book childhood Williamsburg interesting , I book . Also , author 's language Yiddish , writing bit simple clunky . Overall , I wanted expected read . At , I feel tears author . The emotion tangible I felt I writing . Now , writing style different probably : starts explaining background info , final point . This different flow background point , worked book.I story different market currently needed voice . To voice limitations death soul , Abby rose . I ’ SO proud ! I listened audible , narrated author . An interesting story ultra- orthodox boy felt girl made extremely difficult understand accept strong gender roles deviations growing world . For , story jumped lot , grammatical errors Abby Stein left left wife relationship . Mostly interesting deviations ultra orthodox community . Dealing this/ growing space live confines interesting I felt story told This memoir fascinating frustrating time . There intense amount detail things slightly different types clothing worn Hassidic group ( e.g . black tights vs grey tights vs beige tights ) details proceeded point birth author ’ . The massive decisions leave community subsequently transition female handled afterthought , remains clear shattering author ’ life family ’ . Perhaps remain sensitive address superficially , I felt heart short part book hidden . I absolutely loved BECOMING EVE . I listened audiobook , narrated author , I highly recommend reading . Stein incredible writing style . I audiobook review cliche , writing style Stein narrating , feels 're sitting living room chatting cup tea . I BECOMING EVE knowing absolutely Hasidic Judaism , I appreciated patiently carefully Stein explains religion culture . She operates assumption reader n't terminology , n't oversimplify . Fascinating . The subtitle pretty sums memoir stripped-down . Stein tells story insider 's contemporary Hasidic community New York . Stein talks spiritual/religious uncertainties , current relationship Judaism , issues surrounding leaving isolated ultra-orthodox sect community . She read audiobook clarity expression . Her accent underscores fact born raised New York , English language . Thanks audiobook publisher Libro.fm audio review copy . I n't recommend . This frustrating book . I recommend reading interest - fascinating window Hasidic community , I real Abby grow trans community rigidly gendered sex assigned birth . But felt half story I I - basically ends marriage , mention birth , pages explains left Hasidic community ( marriage ) began openly expressing gender identity . If book covers journey TO ultra-orthodox rabbi . Stein engaging writer speaks candidly devotion repression remembers Hasidic upbringing . Her community loving close-knit rigid . The narrative moved quickly . Her dysphoria struggle loneliness leavened moments humor affection community . I hesitated 3-4 stars book structural weakness .
