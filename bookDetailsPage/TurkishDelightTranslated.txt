Strong, visual scenes, a lot, a lot of sex and surprisingly enough still a sensitive love story. You lived very happily, and that has just come to an end. Buddyread with Floor Flawless! To get straight to the point, I start with a quote from the very first page of Turks Delight: I long for you so much.As I write to you, my cunt is making sucking movements like a baby's mouth. The counterculture and the anti-civilization and middle-class life is splashed from the first page.Sex (with everyone, including his girlfriend's mother), filth, mold, snots, misogyny, mocking someone who has breast cancer missing a breast: the book cuts a lot in the first two chapters.There is pee sex as a proposition and of course anal and some spanking are added; every chapter is interspersed with sex. Despite the fact that it comes across as quite intense and gratuitous (even after 50 years), it also produces gems of scenes, such as the penis that gets stuck in the zipper or the puking dog at their wedding reception , who eats too much blackened meat from the then hip and new bbq. And the horror scene where a young Olga puts bread in the mouth of her doll to feed it and she is rewarded with maggots that crawl out of her doll.The attack of vomiting at a Chinese restaurant is also not to be forgotten. Although our nameless protagonist likes to talk about how he has sex 7 times a day and occasionally treats us to a kind of Marquis de Sade, Turkish Delight is ultimately quite gripping love story.He has been abandoned by his Olga and tries to keep up, something that is even more painfully brought to the surface by the sensitive last chapter. Easy to use language, short chapters; I can well imagine why this is still a widely read Dutch classic despite the awkward and sometimes distasteful sex.Three stars.Let me start as everyone expects: yes, this book is packed with explicit scenes in which the euphemisms much needed for prudish people are not present.Sex to the hardcore max.Can't take it?Then quickly put it away and read another book, but know that you are missing something because the way in which Wolkers processes all those explicit anecdotes into an artist's story is good.Wolkers already makes your cheeks blush with his first pages and that is still but the beginning of his writing rollercoaster.We are swept up in the story of an artist who loses the love of his life and comes to terms with it - or at least tries - by drowning in the churning but refreshing river of sexual adventures.A river that was so deep that he drowned the love of his life in it and never saw her again.But after a while they 'resurface' and the chemistry between them remains visible, or legible whichever you prefer.Through a long flashback you get to hear the story of the artist and his Olga.A story told so raw, vulgar and unbrushed that its sweetness takes on the bitter edge it needs.Because you say yourself, we are all tired of the corny love stories by now.And that is exactly what is so genius about Wolkers' book.How he puts you on the wrong path through his narrator's voice.The unique, oratorical power is daring but absolutely successful!How a story told so plainly is so beautiful when you peel away all that explicit, that roughness from it.A tragic but beautiful story wrapped under a particularly rough skin. A bitter flower, that novel.Or a bitter candy, if that fits the title better.Shamelessly filthy and obscenely hilarious, Turkish Delight lays bare all the grotesque absurdity of life, death, love, and ego.At once gruesome and tender, it's painfully believable from start to finish, and studded with snapshot moments of such startling imagery (sometimes beautiful, sometimes disgusting, something both at once) that they're bound to stick with you, long after you've forgotten the characters or context.Certainly not for the faint of heart or weak of stomach, but as compelling now as it must have been fifty years ago.This book started out as a porn.Today as I was reading the last chapter on the bus, I had to try really hard not to start crying - tears were filling my eyes.Never have I felt this much emotional connection with a book.haha sex Buddy-read with HenkI had to get used to the explicit scenes that appear in it.Sometimes I also had the idea that I was reading an erotic book haha!Sometimes the explicit was a bit too much for me.I hadn't gotten over one shock before the next one was right in front of me... But all in all I'm glad I finally read it.After all, it is a Dutch classic.And that while it doesn't feel like an outdated book at all!The writing style looks modern and Wolkers writes quite flat and straightforward.When I look at that time, I can understand why there was a lot of fuss about this book.If it had been published in the present tense, I think it would have been very different.3.5 ✰s This book makes me long to read everything from Wolkers.But really everything: diaries, novels, his visual work, his biography.He is oh so talented and inspiring.The book is written almost entirely with exposition, which is common, I've discovered with translated books.There is very little dialogue.However, its such a good book.Full of raunchy humor and slang.One of the best books I'm read this year, and also ultimately it is so very sad.It's interesting, different from many books, because its translated but it is so unique and full of melancholy and the regret we all feel when a relationship ends.At first I thought the humor would kind of continue but it got progressively darker until the end.The ending was a little disappointing, because it seemed kind of flat in how it ended.There was no emotion in the ending.vond het per onoolk heel mooi Reading this book coincidentally coincided with the death of my favorite actor Rudger Hauer, who starred in Paul Verhoeven's Turkish Delight as Eric, the eccentric sculptor who falls in love with Olga, a contract broker .The two of them live an insane love which is marked by death and its gradual obsolescence.The book (on which the film is based) is as far as I can tell a big deal in Denmark and Volkers is quite well known.It is a text without conventional coherence, something like a diary without dates but more with a record of events and thoughts that gradually narrate the events.The author's flowing speech is quite addictive and the book is an easy read if the reader can withstand the extreme decadent events narrated.Sex-obsessed, eccentric, unconventional, moody and unruly Volker may be annoying at first but manages to win the reader's sympathy with his selfless, passionate love for Olga.Nice read and one of the rare times the movie is as good (maybe better) than the book.three hurray for Jan Wolkers!oversexed man with narrow vocabulary 2.5 Difficult question.After all, this is quite a well-written book with a clearly coherent, even clever and varied story and it's not just about sex, it also has a sensitive side... but it wasn't for me.The book left me cold until half way through.That went better afterwards, among other things I gained more understanding for the main character, I just had to accept that his form of love and the expression of it do not correspond to my own interpretation of it.I did like some passages though and made me cry, but that doesn't outweigh the pages I read purely to get closer to the end. A beautiful story in beautiful prose : Wolkers describes his love story and he describes simultaneously yours and mine.Dnf DM me if you want a free book, Wolkers is trying to be really funny while there's even more humor to be found at a funeral Time is running out so I really need to read a little faster to pass my 2015 reading challenge.For this challenge I still needed 'a classic romance'.I had thought that I could read Woeste Heights for that, but since I was quite apprehensive about that and this is quite a thick and spicy book, I decided to look for another book that meets those requirements.And suddenly I had it!Turkish delight.. Of course.Really a classic love story in the Netherlands and I had never read it before, in short, perfect for my reading challenge! Some people start laughing at the title turkish delight, but actually the book was not too bad.. The first half of the book is decent, uhh well let's keep it neat and call it erotic.The second half of the book is not like that at all.The story is about an artist who loses his great love and remains secretly obsessed with her. Actually, I didn't like the book at all.I found the artist to have a really annoying character.I also found his artful excess boring to read.And I couldn't sympathize with his actions and reservations at all.I thought Olga was sad.A character who is so influenced by her mother's whims that she does very strange things as a result.She clearly has her mother's genes.All in all, a typical literature book in my opinion.Straight forward, not very exciting.Obsessive sex (you can go to therapy for that these days) and more piss and poop than an average toddler can come up with.This was apparently the high point of Dutch literature in 1969.Did I mention sexism and violence (in and out of marriage) against women?Perhaps that did not yet exist at that time, or it was brushed aside because it was the poetic license of the Great Jan Wolkers.There are even streets named after him in the Netherlands... Please note: this is not a generation thing, because even in the 1970s, when I first read this book, I didn't like it 3 times.TF is known as a moving love novel.The narrator (and to what extent it is autobiographical or based on) is mainly in love with himself.All other men are by definition losers or dorks; great artists of the past are also nothing compared to him; and all women (including Olga!)are only there to indulge your lusts.Nowadays we call that misogyny. Still 2 stars?OK, the last few chapters were still manageable, although here too the narrator in the hospital where Olga took her last breath was praised for staying so faithfully.It was about himself again.(rather 3.5 I think) I knew in advance that there would be a lot of sex in this book, but that turned out not to be true.Almost every sexual scene is a rape (here: trigger warning, I wish I had known in advance... maybe others just see this as sex?Haha disturbing, but okay).Very masculine (disgraceful) look, the way women are described is to puke. On the other hand: I didn't really expect anything else from a book from 1969 :) But it's 2021 and so maybe time to look at it with different eyes.Do I find it problematic that this book is still widely read?No, not at all, but I do think we should talk about the problematic side of the book.Other than that, I really enjoyed reading the book.Beautifully and sensitively written, very touching ending.I'm so burnt out from my Dutch Lit.class.I can't tell what I hate anymore: the literature I'm reading or the professors forcing me to read it.To be clear, I did not hate Turkish Delight.However, I did not like it either.I found it hard to sympathize or identify with the narrator, an entitled white man very interested in a woman's beauty and not much in anything else.The female characters, particularly Olga, are two-dimensional and not treated particularly well.The format is at least interesting; it's non-linear, which I did enjoy.I just have a hard time swallowing blatant misogyny and abuse disguised as the sexual liberation of the 1960s especially coming from a man's point of view.Not recommended!The story of a turbulent relationship between a young man and woman.Most of the story is told as memories the guy has of specific moments in their relationship.The majority of the book quite explicitly describes their sex life, but I was impressed with how their relationship shifted from lust to true care and concern.It would be easy to write this off as a weird Dutch book from the 70s whose author is obsessed with sex, but some of the reoccurring themes made me think of it as something more, a la The Goldfinch or a Murakami novel."I see myself in all my pitifulness."stom What an odd book.Really struggled to see the point in this utterly bizarre relationship.Remind me not to trust Dutch recommendations again on "local classics".I read it again because I could vaguely remember that I thought this was such a beautiful book in puberty.The first half took some getting used to (and not what I could remember), but after the last page I concluded what a beautiful and tragic story it is. The associative narrative structure of this story is simply wonderful.As if we crawled into bed next to Olga to reminisce one last time.Read it again after a discussion about this, so it remains a strong book.Found out that I'm really just such a slut for books about unattainable desire, ever since the blueprint (The Sorrows of Young Werther).2.5 stars.It was good, but not what I was expecting, thus the low rating.Wasn't as lascivious as I was expecting.I was expecting a cross between "The Tunnel" and "Hogg".In the end, it was actually quite a love story.Idyllic even.Obsessive love, yes.But not in a very unhealthy way (Olga reveals towards the end that she felt smothered by his "satyriasis" ways.But given she was pretty far gone by the time she reveals this, I think she was somewhat an " unreliable narrator" at that point).The love was reciprocated.Why Olga's behavior changed so suddenly truly could've been attributed to her feeling too worshipped, to her mother's influence, or to her sickness.But I feel she still loved him/wanted to be with him, whatever her reason for leaving.But, bottom line is, I didn't get a "stalker" feeling from the narrator, with some fanatical feelings towards Olga.Even when he complained of her changes, it wasn't a lament for "the old her", trying to keep her static.Rather he lamented seeing she wasn't being authentic.I feel if he'd seen her truly happy with someone else, he would've let her go.There are four quotes from reviews on the cover of the book.I feel these were overstatements.Again, more than the depictions of sex were descriptions of love... such as the art [the narator made] made of Olga.The few erotic statements were great and explicit (though I've read worse).But this is mainly a love story.(Mild spoilers, not actual spoilers though)One of the few books I’ve read that absolutely crushed me.After reading the last lines I sat there for a minute and the started crying my eyes out.I feel like the main theme would be decay.Literally the decay of Olga’s body, and more importantly the decay of their relationship, but not their love.I think that’s why I absolutely love the title; Turkish delight doesn’t decay - and neither did their love.What I really liked was the contrast between the heavy explicit content and the bittersweet love story underneath.I read this book in its original Dutch and maybe that’s why it hit me so hard - books in my native language feel a lot more personal to me.I do want to put a trigger warning on it because of the heavy sexual content - if that makes you feel uncomfortable you probably shouldn’t read the book!Took the time today to read a classic!!First off, go into this book with an initial read up on the literary era it's set in to better place it, and maybe some reviews to "understand" the obsession in his partner.Yes it is oversexed, but that was new and unheard of at the time so the best man went off with it.The story takes you to the bitter end.The core of the story has much more depth than just sex and then it turns out well in the end.It also has quite a modern writing style for a 50+ year old book, you sometimes forget that, interesting &amp; timeless almost.I don't want to praise it all the way to the sky because there has certainly been criticism for a number of things that are not necessarily acceptable in this era, but all in all I was taken by its beautiful writing style and shed a tear.In the beginning I had to retch so many times for scenes described in this book.Then I was disgusted by how horrible the main character is.I didn't find anything romantic about his relationship with Olga.Not only did he gaslight and denigrate her when she was upset about something, but he also assaulted and raped her.Apparently a symbol for the 60s/70s, it makes me especially happy that I wasn't alive then.funny at the beginning, heart-rending at the end.. Turkish delight is my bible.Wolkers really is a genre in itself. Have voices been raised that say that the language in this book needs to be changed, as was done in Great Britain with Roald Dahl and Agatha Christie?Little of this book would remain and even worse, no one would understand why this book hit like a bomb. An unsuspecting contemporary reader who happens to get hold of this book (huh?How?Who then?)would perhaps have been helped with a note in the front of the book explaining the time in which it was written.In any case, do not modify works of art!The fact that this book was published in the year '69 has been a good marketing stunt, because the passages with 'fuck', 'sew' and 'beast with two backs' are tiresomely present, especially in the first half of the book.Never read such a tragic ending in words.All I have to say is that this book is much more than the explicit content in it.Both this and that I can't wait to read more of Wolkers' books.Η κωμικοτραγική ιστορία μιας αρρωστημένης καψούρας... if you think away the misogyny from the book (which is very difficult), very interesting to read how a man from the city in this era looks at the world around.a bit oversexed, and mainly from the male perspective, but still interesting enough to regret that the book is over :p Counts few pages and half consists of sex scenes, but still very moving.Unexpectedly good book!I really like the coarse, rustic but at the same time poetic language in this book.It makes me think about the main character's personality.In college we were talking about this book and just about everyone thought it was a huge dick and very sexist.I myself think that he thought many things that more people think, but that he is one of the few who is completely honest.He thought a lot, but acted little.Are you an asshole or not??But admittedly, it is (a bit) sexist.By today's standards, he has already assaulted about 3 women on page 30 (he acted accordingly in that area).Otherwise whole.a lot of.six.Nonstop.Nice and explicit and juicy 😏.Well described by means of long sentences with 100 juxtapositions.I liked that less.But in the end what sticks with me the most is the honesty and beautiful display of love for Olga &lt;3 Veľmi dobrá kniha.A fascinating look at the relationship between two people, their downright animalistic passion, growing love, but also arguments, mutual misunderstanding, pain, sadness and misunderstanding of the environment.Given very directly, without any attempt to embellish life.The style of the narrator's speech also corresponds to this - he uses explicit expressions of various nature regarding sex or life in general.The author clearly does not put a napkin in front of his mouth.It probably won't be to everyone's liking.However, I liked reading about the author's relationship with Olga.I didn't always understand or approve of his decisions and behavior towards her and those around him, but nevertheless their story intrigued me.At first, the book may seem like porn on paper, but gradually other layers of their lives are revealed, which are worth reading and thinking about.This book started out a bit strange.I read the first few chapters with raised eyebrows because oh, how the main character behaved like a pig, horrible.At the end this changed a little bit and I really just felt sorry for him.His whole life is dominated by Olga, who was really not a nice girl and let her terrible mother lead her whole life. Although I couldn't really bear the main characters and the book is actually very sad, somehow I think this story will stay with me.3 out of 5 Stars pornografi ile dramı birlikte kullanmak ilginç olmuş.The language outside of the drama is very aggressive, I drifted from thoughts to thoughts while reading.Even if it's not a very good book, it's a very different experience.Beautiful.At least also special, that warm world, hot passion and the even hotter hell between Olga and Eric.Content that I have finally read this pearl of Dutch literature.This was honestly the worst book I've ever had to read for Literature.Just came here to hate on this book the imagery in this book is visceral.i will probably remember some of the images this book described far longer than i remember the plot, simply because the writing is so explicit, and not only when it comes to sex.however, my favorite parts were the more tender moments between the two main characters.the last chapter was especially touching.reading this, i think ilja leonard pfeijffer must have been heavily influenced by jan wolkers.unfortunately, their narrative style is not really my favorite.Anyone can say what they want about this book, I've heard different opinions about it, but I loved it.When I started reading, while reading and when I finished it.I loved it from start to finish, despite the indeed very explicit excerpts in the book.Underneath was a very beautiful, sensitive love story.Wolkers writes sensuously and lyrically and thus shows himself as a true stylist within the Dutch language, but he also falls prey to his own artist cliché in which life, love and sex are written in elegant capitals.This results in passionate scenes, passages full of humor and bigotry, but in the end his world view is a pitiful residue as he continues to model the woman of his life, Olga, in his imagination until little remains of it but the old-fashioned idea that only the man makes and breaks the woman.Turks Fruit is thematically dated, but has not lost any of its expressiveness in its writing style.What's a Dutch book without raw, explicit sex scenes, right?That aside, I thought it was a touching book that masterfully reveals the simplicity and complexity of broken relationships.Certain things would really be unacceptable in times of me-too, but of course you have to see the story in a certain zeitgeist.little tear shed at the end I devoured this book in one sitting!P.S.: for those who want to have the full reading experience, my book (original first edition!!)borrow :) omg ,,, just say u hate women &amp; go When I just started this story, I didn't always like the dirty writing style to read and for that reason I often put the book down.Thus, I have read the story over a long period of time and I can say that it is a good book to read after ending a relationship.The raunchy writing style is somehow even therapeutic and I really enjoyed the story.This one has been on my to read list since my senior year of high school.Then everyone wanted to read the book because there was so much sex in it and it was always on loan.A nice full circle moment.2.5 Fragile book 2.5 stars. Contextually it certainly fits in its time.Imagery takes on a new meaning here, haha.I'm sure Kol would be proud 'When I later came across that silhouette of her hardboard body in the rubble, looking for those cursed tree frogs, I took it to the mirror and put it next to me.Then I put my hands on her hips and looked at our reflection.I felt and saw that fabric again and I tried to imagine her as she was then.But I always saw her as she had become and when I shook off that image I was left alone with that outline.A template, a shadow of her.A blueprint of our happiness, which you had to be able to read, otherwise it was just a brown piece of cardboard.' Of course there is an exaggerated amount of sex in it, but that must have been the spirit of the times.I actually thought it was a beautiful love story.I just don't quite understand what the role of 'Turks Delight' is, I get the idea that this gets a much bigger role in the film, while the book only mentions it in a subordinate clause. Nevertheless, I finally read it.Of course I should have done it much sooner!A beautifully literary but clearly written love story, full of explicit sex and the raw sadness of life.What was once undoubtedly taboo-breaking now feels almost anachronistic.In listening to the book on the Bookbeat app, read by the writer himself, certainly an added value!I get that this book is a classic and it was very provocative for its time, but I wasn't fully into the story.The explicit use of language made me uncomfortable at times and some scenes are simply described too animalistically.The ending is very sad and ironic at the same time.Ahja it is not about Turkish delight at all.I'm sobbing on a beach in Antibes by the end of this delightful book which, as I said, has made me cry, laugh and even frown at the vulgar passages!Oh dear sweet Olga Turks Fruit is seen as a revolutionary book, a love novel in which sex is very explicit.Jan Wolkers is seen as one of the first who dared to do so.And what a tragic ending, in which the narrator loses his great love.This is one view, but it becomes a completely different one if we put Olga at the center.Let's do that for a moment. In summary, you can call Olga's life miserable.A young woman who is constantly victimized by men.When Olga's father died: 'And at night in bed she lay softly sighing in my arms, her wet wisps of hair glued to her face.But that fucked nicely, that willless apathetic body.And I almost tricked her into not putting on the diaphragm, for there's nowhere more meaningful making a child than over a dying one.'This first quote already shows how mister views women.Sex is nice when it is unresisting, making a child is careless, and the woman's feelings are ignored while her father is dying.The story continues.The whole story of the relationship between Olga and narrator is discussed, a lot of sex, sometimes something else, but you never really get to know Olga.The story is definitely not about Olga.Occasionally a thought or conversation is displayed, but not too often.Eventually the relationship/marriage breaks down.Olga seems to have flirted with another man, whereupon she is assaulted by the narrator.Not long after, she is brutally raped by the narrator.The divorce is, of course, on the grounds that she has committed adultery, there is no mention of violence.In the remaining part of the book, the marriages that Olga has had afterwards are told.She becomes pregnant by the second husband and undergoes a violent amateur abortion that leaves her with inflamed ovaries and feels sick for a long time to come.This second man is often drunk and aggressive.He tries to rape her and she flees.The marriage with her third husband also breaks down.Her ovaries remained inflamed from the abortion she had earlier.Her husband finds it annoying that he can't have sex with her and is constantly possessed.When she is out with another man, her husband finds out and abuses her.He punches her in the face and eventually even shoots her in the face with a revolver, leaving her with a huge scar on her face.In the end, she develops a brain tumor and dies in the hospital.Jan Wolkers has based Olga on three women who have been in his life, and the book seems to be dedicated to them as well.An article by Jean-Pierre Geelen in de Volkskrant of 27 February 2012 states: 'If other men paid attention to me [Annemarie Nauta, with whom Jan Wolkers lived in the 1950s], it was not good', she told.Then there were 'claps'.Wolkers, certainly the last years of his life a national pet bear, turned out to be obsessive, possessed and jealous.'Turkish Delight is certainly partly based on what Wolkers himself experienced and did to women.Turkish Delight is on the reading list of many high school students.I hope it will be talked about in a way that shows how women were treated in the post-war years, and to some extent still today.Sexism, assault, violence, rape.Women still go through this and it destroys lives.Beautiful book, almost cried Vulgar and hilarious book but romantic and sad at the same time, reads very smoothly."Three cheers for Jan Wolkers!"Explicit, crude vocabulary from the pen of a passionate lover, an admirer.Easy to read, beautifully structured and poetically written in its own way.(3,5/5) And yes, it took me way too long to finish this book that didn't even have a lot of pages, but to be honest, I found it hard to get in to.It had too many curse words and lots of sex.If you look past that, it is an interesting novel, that I might, maybe, one day, in the future, read it again.But I don't think this will happen anytime soon.In this novel, we follow Erik, a young sculptor, who meets the young Olga, when he is hitchhiking to get home to Amsterdam.They end up having lubricious relationship that involves graphic descriptions of their love and sex life, plus a whole lot other stuff.Back when Jan Wolkers wrote this book at first, it was quite a shocker.It was real and the descriptions made man think that it was a pornographic book, which is was not.It definitely contains a lot of sex, but I think this is a really romantic love story as well.Erik stays somehow faithful to his love for Olga, despite her leaving him.He still loves her and he can't really live without her.The story is written in flashbacks and thoughts of Erik and doesn't contain a lot of dialogue, that made it hard to read the novel, as it contained long sentences, that contained fairly difficult words and long pieces of texts.There weren't any paragraphs, except when the new chapter began.I must admit that the author, Jan Wolkers, has a humorous way of writing.He compares things to other things in a way I had never thought about it.He uses metaphors in strange, yet fitting ways.This made up for the rating, I would have given it only one star otherwise.Somehow I didn't expect more of this book.I had hoped it would be better, given that this is literature.I am not sure who to recommend it to.Maybe you should watch the movie first, to see if the story speaks to you.But I doubt this will happen to a lot of people.If you have read it, let me know what you thought.I would love to hear from you.🍑 TURKISH FRUIT by Jan Wolkers 🍑 For The School of Life Amsterdam - Famous Writers about Famous Books, Marieke Lucas Rijneveld has chosen Turkish Fruit by Jan Wolkers to read and discuss together.After reading it, it is clear where Rijneveld at least partly gets their inspiration from 😅 The same ominous feeling I got at De evening is discomfort I also had at Turks Delight.After reading the first few pages I felt like I was reading a porn book.I found many of the lyrics rather misogynistic and just gross, but as the story progressed, the book got more depth and reflection and you start to care a little more about the main character.I think the book shows how double love can be, how beautiful but also how painful (and how vulgar 😅).I got the impression that in the beginning Wolkers mainly tries to shock the reader by pasting as many graphic vulgar sentences as possible before he wants to show the narrator vulnerable to the reader.Interesting.. at the beginning I really thought, why am I reading this, it's just a guy who is obsessed with sex and talks very dirty, but that would be too simple.At the end I was glad I had finally read it.Nevertheless, I don't understand why this book is everywhere on the reading lists in high school, because that doesn't seem very appropriate, but maybe I'm a bit too conservative in this regard?Anyway, a must read once, but I wouldn't read it again.A colleague thought I should read some more classics and less than a day later came along with Turks Delight and I, Jan Cremer.I often don't like classics very much, so I decided to start with the thinnest: Turkish Delight. It tells the turbulent love story of Olga and the nameless narrator.From the start, the relationship between the two is turbulent and Wolkers does not hesitate to tell his readers this in full.Even now, at the end of 2019, the language is quite explicit and it is therefore not surprising that the book caused such a stir years ago.I'm pretty open-minded myself, but I noticed that the word choices and the detailed descriptions bothered me at times.Sex is okay, but Turkish Delight contains an abundance that are certainly not all necessary for the story. Apart from these candid scenes, it is actually a great story.The love of the nameless one splashes off the pages and enough information is given in the small number of pages to form a picture of the family.Yet you notice that it is an older book.What used to be good just isn't that special anymore.We've all read it by now, and even better and more extensively.Turkish Delight falls under the Dutch Classics and I can understand this classification well.If I had been born a few years earlier or had read the book years earlier, it probably would have made a lot more of an impression.In the 1970s I thought Jan Wolkers was great and then I read almost everything from him except Turkish delight.Because I haven't seen the movie either, I thought it would be nice to read this book from 1969.It is a rather crudely painted story in which the main character (he has no name but is a visual artist just like the writer himself) looks back on his relationship with Olga.The style in particular seems to be a reaction to the Protestant Netherlands and the prudish sexuality of that time.That was undoubtedly also the reason why I loved Wolkers' books as a teenager: very readable and, in addition to drama, also a lot of humor and sex.” I put my hands around her buttocks and pressed her against me.And stuck my tongue into that moist notch.She moaned and groaned and her high heels tapped the floor with the trembling tension and suddenly she jerked forward slightly and, with both hands against the top of my head, pressed my face into that soft luxuriance of flesh.Then she twisted her cunt around my tongue.” Then I found Wolkers' style young and wild.Now I think it's a bit dated.But also pure nostalgia: completely 60s!The test of time?Never heard of it!!!The virality, the virility, the passion and the deep warmth in which you are carried away...The images that splash from the magazine...The language that flows like a mountain river after a thunderstorm that lasts for weeks.Cheers, Jan Wolkers.After more than half a century, this book more than just stands, it lives and vibrates and drags you along.Even though you know how it ends, you have to go with it to the last word, to the last gesture of deep love."That she was so used to it herself."Magnifique, even for a reread, what a blast, what a brilliant piece of literature.Books like this will not and cannot be made today, there is no question about that.This is one I recommend to everyone.2.5 stars, idek I made a spoiler-free video review about Turkish Delight!https://youtu.be/V5OBKPDYgZE Bittersweet Okay, this book got 2 stars because I honestly experienced the first half as light-hearted and funny, but after reading this review that is still too high. In the beginning there are two timelines.Namely, that the main character meets Olga and they break up, he is very sad here.He also rents out his front room to two American students and you get his vague sexual thoughts all the time, about them and everything and yes idk.Olga's father is a bit clumsy and carefree.He doesn't really care that his wife keeps cheating and he keeps singing vague songs and telling puns. Olga's mother keeps cheating.In addition, she is against the relationship of the main character and Olga.MC meets Olga because she picked him up when he hitchhiked.Then they had a one-night stand.Mc is completely hopelessly in love and meets olga again and they have an intimate relationship what the hell did i read. an emotional intimate bond but no, sewn. Then again in the past they travel throughout the Netherlands and get married.Olga has a great fear of getting pregnant and having children. Oh yes, this whole book has no paragraphs and reads like 1 block. And yes.I forgot the name of the main character.But then..DUDU DUUUUno wayOlga calls her mother more and more She calls her mother more often, who 'poisons' her with stories about richly married daughters, who can make long journeys in expensive cars.Olga wants to "break free from his embrace."She is still with him on New Year's Eve.And so the new year began for us.The year in which I would lose her forever."Olga flirts with a man in a restaurant and the mc gets furious and punches him in the face.Mc blames the mother for Olga's cheating.They break up.They meet again later.Olga is not a ginger anymore (congratulations).But mc finds that completely horrible and labels her as fake.In addition, Olga is married and divorced to all kinds of rich men and she looks unhappy. Then she does it when she sleeps.No no way that is literally rape and then it is justified because she likes it while she didn't have it unsolicited??!Then Olga has cancer.She only wants to eat Turkish delight.Wow what a title statement!Only I find "what am I doing to myself?"veel beter1/5  Turks Fruit was originally published in 1969.It reads remarkably freshly still.The novel recounts the ill-fated, obsessive love affair between the narrator, a sculptor, and a beautiful red-headed woman, Olga, who comes from a wealthy if dysfunctional family.Its sexual explicitness, at times from an entitled-seeming male perspective, can induce certain qualms in the modern reader, and in one or two places real queasiness: it's a novel of its time.But it is also rawly honest and graphic in its depiction, in earthy language, of lust and sex and bodily fluids in all their embarrassing and often amusing messiness.Not all is pure romantic passion.In addition, it conveys not only the narrator's sexual urges, but Olga's too, granting her sexual autonomy and desire (in a way that I imagine was still rather rare at the time).The story starts with the narrator's desolation over Olga's abandonment of him, for no apparent good reason, for some dull business contact of her parents.It cycles back to the beginning of the relationship, through its highs and lows, to its breakup, and to the affectingly sad aftermath.Along the way its narrator manages to drop his air of a young man on the frenetic hunt for sexual experience in the newly liberated sixties, and becomes more human, grieving.He is constantly reminded of apparently insubstantial episodes from their life together (often involving tenderness towards the stray animals that cross their path - a duck, a seagull).Turks Fruit is, finally, the story of a man deeply marked by a love that survives his beloved's loss of her youth and beauty.A flawed novel, but a powerful and engaging one with considerable emotional heft.An English version was published in 2017 as Turkish Delight, trans.Sam Garrett.Last week, in the context of '100 years of WF Hermans', I intended to read more of the Big Four.How can you actually find something if you haven't taken Mulisch, Wolkers, Reve and Hermans to you?Right.Turks Delight is a timeless book that really grabs the reader, especially in the second part.It's mostly known for its erotic (if you can call it that) passages, but of course it's much more than that.Personally I see it more as the fight of the free-spirited spirit (the main character Eric is a poor sculptor in Amsterdam) against the changing society and wishes of his one true love Olga.It was published in 1969, but in the long run Olga expresses the zeitgeist of the 1980s and 1990s in the book.Wanting more, more unrest, more money and more materialism.In the end, this wish is 'punished' and comes to a bitter end.If this were to be published now, it would speak of the Houllebecqian style of the book.I haven't seen the movie yet.I found fun/funny/interesting passages: the first meeting and accompanying car ride, the regularly recurring jokes of Olga's puffy father ('it was a murder with patience'), Olga's animals in the studio (a duck, weasel, cat, frogs and pigeons) and of course the terrible returning mother.'You lived very happily, and that just came to an end.'That's how it is.Today, Turks Delight is probably remembered more for the over-explicit sex scenes than for the book's literary qualities.The first few chapters are fun to read.After about 50 pages they feel increasingly superfluous.The same goes for the style of the book.At first the strange style is still nice, but after a while the absence of paragraphs becomes irritating. It is actually a pity that Wolkers found it necessary to kick all moral and literary rules so exaggeratedly, because under the foul language and the paragraphless chapters is still quite an interesting book.The story – about the main character's relationship with his muse Olga, and his obsession with her when she leaves him – is intriguing in its own right, although it is never fully fleshed out.The characters, too, on the rare occasions when they don't engage in extensive sexual soliloquia, can still be quite deep.The unnamed main character in particular becomes more and more three-dimensional towards the end of the book; unfortunately I had largely lost my interest by then. Now it is especially interesting to read because of the literary relevance - how Wolkers tries to overthrow all norms and values ​​of the 1960s with his book.That's too bad.If he had spent a little more time on the story and the characters, and not on yet another sex scene, it could have been another excellent book.It began with my face curling up in disgust and ended with my face covered in black running mascara lines.The tears came suddenly and stayed for a while after the book was closed…And it makes evaluating and rating it so hard.On one hand, it’s disgusting, venturing into things I’ve never even read about before.Kinks and fetishes and dirty sex-related adventures.On the others hand it’s a heartbreaking story of an artist, loving to the point of hating.And a woman, constantly running away in hopes to find her happiness at the next stop.It is as deep as it is vulgar.And as immortal as it is old-fashioned.It breathes 60s-70s but is still relatable in 2020s…Very hard to break into, but worth it in the end.I recognize the vulgarity as part of the time it was written in but I think the story wouldn’t suffer if it had less of it.Passionate surrender and individual hedonism form the driving force of the novel: the book exudes the zeitgeist of the 1960s/1970s.At the same time, Wolkers knows how to move when fierce love and passion have to make way for time that erases everything and for death.All that remains are melancholy and memories of that love beautifully described by Wolkers: "whatever you have done, what you are doing or will do, wherever you go, I will always love you!".Finally, the book is comical in all its flat observations: "Catholic Truus, fat from eating fish on Friday and full of saliva when French kissing."In short: a humorous and at the same time tragic sensual story.As far as I'm concerned, even after 50 years a recommendation.This one had been on the list of classics that I still wanted to read for a while and it just so happened that I had it at home when the media paid attention to the book due to the fact that it was too expensive.the book's 50th anniversary.I didn't really know about the book other than that it would be about sex.There is indeed a lot of room for explicit descriptions of sex, but it is also about love and what love can do to a person.I didn't always find the descriptions of the sex necessary, but the story was nice.The writing style has made me curious about other work by Wolkers.This novel by Wolkers is initially hilarious, as overly sexual as everything is described.But of course it's a way of coping with the great heartache that hits him when his loved one abandons him.As the book progresses, Wolkers' raw style feels less and less appropriate and even seems to ebb away.Until the moving end, in which the whole is laid out like a kind of puzzle, with the last pieces in place.The Olga love really existed, but the end of the book is based on the life of another friend of Wolkers.That might make it feel a little too polished, less raw; as if, indeed, it is about someone other than his great love. It is, incidentally, a novel that I keep on my shelf, because I re-read it once in a while.And then I have to laugh again at the lust and sigh at the mother-in-law and nod sympathetically when it is all about the love that lasts for another.Beautiful book.Many people associate Turkish delight with a sex book or a story that is only about sex.I can't deny that there is no sex in it, but I didn't think it was over the top.I liked the story that was told much better, those passages fit in well.It made the main characters appear much more alive.I felt that it made you understand much more what they were going through and how they feel.It is a story with a lot of love, lust, passion, emotion and candor.I liked it.I had heard of the story, but never really wanted to read it myself.In the end, I'm very glad I chose to read it anyway.A raw depiction of a time and a place and a mindset that’s grimly, provocatively fascinating to observe and leaves you feeling unclean in its wake.While also being sexy and funny and full of grotesque imagery.That our narrator is so difficult to like –despite an invigoratingly stark way with words– makes his self-pitying journey of visceral sexual carnage towards a redemption of sorts all the more interesting.Troubling and sweet in its depiction of unharnessed masculinity in the face of romantic breakdown; toxic, but tender.When I first started reading this book, I thought it would be some William S. Burroughs-Esque text; fragmented, obscene, vulgar, thrilling, etc.But, as the narrative continued, the protagonist grew so tender.Through his heartbreak, the illusion of Olga was stripped away into a harsh light, and her character came into more precise focus as a complicated female figure.I think this book is as much about parent-child relationships as it is about romantic love.I began to truly understand his perspective and why he chose to collage her in a series of slightly crude, slightly hilarious vignettes in the beginning.I couldn't pity his obsessive love towards her, however misogynistic or male-gazey he came across at times.I especially loved the careful attention to the interactions with animals; those parts were the most touching for me.The ending devastated me.Unlike many things I’ve read before.One word to describe it is ‘grostesque’ - I can see why it was banned/scandalised at publication back in the day.Saying that I still strangely enjoyed it and became invested in the narration.The combination of the narrators quirky, dark and obsessive personality with the rollercoaster of emotions he experiences in lust, love and heartbreak was an interesting read.Turkish Delight has been on my list for a while because it's a classic, something you should read once.Now after reading it I understand why this book carries this title.It shocked me with all the sexual details and deeply moved me at the same time.Being able to write a love story so well deserves nothing but praise.a lot of sex, the ending was of course heartbreaking how Olga ended up, if the author described more to details their relationship and not fill it with one night stands, weird fetishes and sex scenes, i would have liked it more.i understand that he was the first one to openly talk about this topic but still, it was unnecessary.Quote: "And I loved her so much I just forgot when I was going to zip up my jeans that my cock wasn't in my underwear yet.I screamed in pain and immediately couldn't move.The skin of my cock was caught between the brass rails.(...) And no matter how I fiddled, I couldn't open that vicious rotten thing.It looked like real human flesh that came between the tram switch.And the pain also kept my cock crazed and erect with its red tip erect, while the skin sandwiched between the brass turned purple."Plot This book is a classic (1969) but for those who missed it then, and for the young among us, a summary: this is the story of a beautiful, wonderful, happy love with lots of sex.However, the love does not last, probably because the girl Olga is traumatized by the upbringing of her very bossy mother.Olga is incapable of a lasting beautiful love affair.Even when she has broken up with the narrator, she keeps remarrying all kinds of others without being able to be happy forever.Autobiography?There are quite a few rumors on the internet about the autobiographical content of this book.Jan Wolkers would have said it was autobiographical.But in what way?Although much can be found in the book about his short-lived relationship with Annemarie Nauta, that relationship was an important source of inspiration, but other wives and girlfriends of Wolkers also inspired.It also seems clear that the book is not autobiographical in the sense that the first-person narrator and Wolkers themselves do not completely match.In the book he describes an ideal love.Olga can't keep this up.But the bad sides of Jan Wolkers himself are just as well underexposed.He's long been a reader's teddy bear, but he did have bouts of aggression, was jealous and oversexed, drank, I don't know.It wouldn't have been that bad, but he probably wasn't such an enjoyable fairytale prince either.The book is therefore certainly not completely autobiographical. However, that does not matter.We should certainly not read from the idea that the I-figure is Jan Wolkers himself.And then we have a beauty of a book that is recommended for the youth who do not yet know Jan Wolkers, and for the elderly among us who had not yet read it.Current style "Turkish delight" reads as if it was written yesterday.It remains very current on a human and sexual level. The style, dynamics, the choice of words, it is all very beautifully written.The use of words is simple but accurate, and beautifully explicit in the sex scenes. When reading the book it is good to keep in mind that Wolkers was one of the first to write about sex in this way.Nowadays we no longer find these sex scenes rude or dirty, but that was different in his time.For us it is still fantastic that Jan Wolkers has broken a lance for us in that area.And this way of writing about sex is still relevant today.Not only is the book beautifully written, it is also very humorous and often hilarious.Wolkers can make even sad passages exceptionally funny.Conflicting ending In the end, the story becomes not only poignant, but also confusing, as if two stories are being told at the same time.One story is that of a beautiful love.Unfortunately, Olga is too attached to her mother, and under her influence she is unable to embrace lasting happiness and love with the first-person narrator.The I-figure is completely powerless against that.That's a story you can read in the end.Could have read.It would be a harrowing but beautiful story, and plausible too. But then Wolkers, almost for the first time in the novel, suddenly lets Olga speak.Suddenly she says that she found her relationship with the narrator stifling.She complains about him and describes his flaws.It then seems that it is not because of Olga's relationship with her mother, but because of the relationship with the narrator that she leaves him.As a reader you don't know anymore.Never before have the negative sides of the I-figure been highlighted in the novel, it was always a wonderful love and infatuation.You lived in another story, that of a perfect love with two perfect lovers and an Evil Mother (and she is also Evil).Suddenly everything tilts.Did Wolkers still want to emphasize the autobiographical element at the end, put his hand in his own bosom?Then he should have done that from the start.Now the coherence is lost at the end. Very good book! Don't let the end put you off.That is also very readable, because Wolkers was an author who wrote beautiful texts.The whole book that comes before it is perfect, beautiful, and hilarious.And the way Wolkers started writing about sex, a way that is still so pleasant and topical, for all these reasons it is recommended to read this classic of Dutch literature.This was quite an experience.This writing style doesn't really suit my preference and I didn't finish the book easily, but all in all this is a beautiful and tragic love story.In retrospect, I'm glad I persevered and now know the story.A bit explicit I thought I'd read an old Dutch classic... Didn't expect it to be so rude... But it's also comical and tragic at the same time.Special.A hot hell.How beautiful this book is.(vastberaden om dit boek te haten, maar het is me niet gelukt) (3.5) The book is shocking from the first pages.But after reading it, it becomes one of the most beautiful stories of the expression of love that I have read 🙂 De tranen springen me in de onderbroek Binnen een dag uitgelezen.You can't go wrong with this book.How such a coarse, dirty and raw book is somehow sweet and tender.My first Jan Wolkers book and the bar is high for the next one.If Satyriasis were a book, this is the book. This used to be my favorite book, now I hate it.Still excellent I prepared myself for a hateread but was pleasantly surprised.Plotwise: a lot of misery could have been avoided if Olga had been on the pill and had access to legal abortion!Weird.5 stars.I debated throughout the whole book whether it's 1 star or 5 stars, but I'm out.I guess... The shit I do for school, ugh― I'm glad we didn't have to watch the movie.Otherwise I would go crazy.Filled with a lot of minor observations, this is a very delightful read.Very compelling.***read for pws and because it's an nl classic***Okay, I get why a lot of people think this book is a dirty pack of dirty sex and weird references.That's it a bit.But I did enjoy most of it, even the sex scenes I was secretly laughing or watching fascinated.Not a book I really want on my shelf, but I'm glad it exists.Tits ass, tits ass, tits ass, ass, ass, tits ass, tits ass, tits ass, ass, ass. That's what most people say about this book.And yes there is a lot of sex, but not that much, and I understand that prudish people are shocked by this, but expect that because this is just a love story by Jan Wolkers.Like this.Nice.Maybe it's the time I read it.And it's my first Wolkers.But what a beautiful emotional book.I normally never read romance books but this one hits different.A sad, sometimes visually a lot but yet amazing.The end was really heavy for me as I know someone who went the same way.Beautifully written, watching the trees go from brown to snowy and then watch them bloom... this was a very difficult read for me personally, but still could not put it down.the story is at once beautiful and grotesque, definitely deserving of some TW's (domestic violence, sexual abuse etc...) will definitely not forget this book easily, and i'm not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing a love that leaves its mark on your life, a love that collides with the ego and death, a love as sweet as Turkish delight... Een drieluik van beestachtige liefde, diep zelfmedelijden en wraak."You lived very happily, and it just came to an end" (Turks Delight, p. 97).Idk man, I think it's a very good book a little too sexual but in the core a really nice story!extremely horny.read like the rachel papers but with higher stakes.The title of the book I read is "Turkish Delight".The book was written by Jan Wolkers, an author that I honestly did not know at the beginning.I chose this book because the title appealed to me.Why it attracted me?Because I myself am of Turkish origin.I thought the book was going to spin about a Turkish family, but to my surprise it was completely not the case.In short, the story revolves around love.It is about a love relationship between a woman and a man.The woman calls Olga and the name of the man is not mentioned in the book, because the story is told from a first-person perspective.After a car accident, the first person never saw Olga again.After 1-2 months, he sees her again and they both fall in love with each other.They got married and lived together.Then, the first person talks about their day-to-day relationship, how they interact, their sexual relationship, etc.He also describes the relationship he has with Olga's parents.In the book we find out that Olga's mother didn't like the first person.She did everything to break them up and she was able to do it with great success, because Olga often listens to her mother.Afterwards, the first person fell into depression and in order to forget about Olga, he started having sexual relations with several women.Even if he did, he couldn't forget Olga.That is why he went back to Alkmaar to discuss with Olga.He then had sex with Olga again that night and when Olga's mother knew, she sent him away.After a while, the first person sees Olga again.Olga tells the first person that she is married, but according to the first person she was not doing well psychologically.After some years, the I-person came to know that Olga was getting married again and she was going to America with her husband.That's why the I-person decided to send a letter to Olga.When Olga read the letter, she made the decision to visit the first person.When she came to him, she told more about her marriage.Then she left for America with her husband. From America, Olga wrote letters to the first person and after a few months she came back to Amsterdam, because she had to see a doctor for her stomach and headache.In the end, we came to know that Olga had a brain tumor and that there was no solution left to cure her.The first-person often visited her because she was always so important to him.He always bought her Turkish delight because she could only eat Turkish delight.Unfortunately, Olga died in the end and it wasn't a happy ending at all.My opinion of the book is only positive, because first of all it is a very beautiful and well thought-out story.Also, it's a sad story, because it ends with a death.Then because it was written from a first-person perspective, the story was really compelling, because you lived exactly the events with the main character.The emotions are so strong in the story that you can feel the emotions yourself.Exactly that I was actually the main character, when I read the book.Theme wise, it was really well invented.The themes here are love and death.Which are very interesting themes for the teenagers.The book actually reminded me of the movie “Fault in our stars”, a very beautiful movie that revolves around love, illness and death.When reading the story, you don't pick up everything quickly, because it's not very well structured.Each chapter actually has a separate story, which made it a bit difficult to follow.The story is not structured chronologically, because there are constant flashbacks.Second, when I finished reading the book I realized that the things described in the book had greater meanings, more specifically "symbolic" meanings.Behind the title “Turkish delight” there is another meaning that I didn't know.“Turkish Delight” not only stands for the sweets that the I-person bought for Olga when he went to the hospital to visit Olga, but the title also stands for the rottenness of their relationship.It is also an unexpected story, because in the beginning I did not know at all that it was about an illness and that it was going to end unhappily.Finally, I recommend the book to young people or adults who like to read dramatic stories.For me personally, it really wasn't a disappointment and if I still have to read it, I'll do it without any problem.That is why I recommend the book to young people and/or adults who like to read dramatic stories.So if you get a chance to read the book, read it and it won't be a disappointment.trust me!Bibligraphic address : Title : Turks delightAuthor : Jan WolkersPublisher : J. M. MeulenhoffFirst edition : 1969Place : Amsterdam Number of pages.: 192 Biography : Jan Hendrik Wolkers (Oegstgeest, October 26, 1925 - Westermient, October 19, 2007) grew up in a strictly Reformed family.With his first wife he had three children, one of whom died.He had twins with his third wife.His youth in Oegstgeest, his Reformed background, his great love (his second wife Annemarie Nauta modeled for Olga in Turks Fruit), the loss of his child and many other events from his life, he has processed in his novels.Wolkers made his debut in 1961 at the age of 32 with the short story collection Serpentina's Petticoat.Until then he mainly worked as a visual artist.His debut was followed by a stream of novels and stories.Typical of Wolkers is the way in which he writes candidly about sexuality, art, decay and death.His work was appreciated by a wide audience.Wolkers refused almost all oeuvre prizes that were awarded to him, only in 1991 did he accept the Busken Huet Prize for his collection Tarzan in Arles.The strongly visual way of writing invited filmmakers to film his work.Various novels, including Turks Fruit, Summer Heat, Short American and A Rose of Meat, have now been filmed.Wolkers remained active as a sculptor, painter and writer until the end of his life, until he died on October 19, 2007 on Texel, the island of where he lived since 1980. (https://www.leidenvoordelijst.nl/zoek-...)Between filthy and sublime How much can you love to see someone? Jan Wolkers proves in his scandalous novel from the 1960s that love can make people navigate between unprecedented heights of adoration and pleasure and painful depths of distance, horror and loss.45 years after publication, Turks Delight has unfortunately had to lose a lot of its narrative power.The explicit scenes remain obscene and dirty, but they don't really cross borders (anymore).Or do I, as a reader, have too many calluses on my retina?The first-person narrator knows very convincingly how to write down his love and adoration for Olga - I even became silent for a moment after reading the closing passage - but all things considered, Turks Delight is little more than a diary of a broken heart. The often very Dutch terminology , the strange attention to animals (intertwined with a maternal motif) and the petty wails about Olga too often took me out of the story.Fortunately, Wolkers' sentences also regularly put a cynical smile on my face.Wolkers is unparalleled in the picture he paints of the mother-in-law and also in the gory details (the suds full of bird shit that runs under the skirting boards and the painful incident with the fly are images that will stay with me) and the stark contrast between life as it had and the diluted reality remains the book intact. Turkish Delight reads smoothly, but unfortunately remains too small-scale in terms of content to really make a lasting impression.Turks Delight by Jan Wolkers is a daring book. When you address people about this story, they immediately think of dirty sex and porn (taking into account that this was written in 1969, when society still viewed sex differently, it was taboo ).I don't think this is the case.There are scenes about peeing and rough sex, but those elements add spice to Jan Wolkers' narration.The theme of love also contains a large part of the book.A man who found the love of his life, but let the girl slip away.He regrets that.He misses her, but that's not why he cries all the time.Many more adventures pass through his life. In this book, Jan Wolkers gets the chance to bring forward his unique language.The somewhat simple story of an artist and his girlfriend is given a solid and even exciting basis by the way of telling.There is a lot of use of flashbacks and imagery. Even the more risky passages are written straight to the point.The author doesn't talk about 'making love', but about 'fucking'.That way of writing has a shock effect, but once at the end of the book, you thank Jan Wolkers for his original language.I was already familiar with Rogier van Otterloo's beautiful soundtrack of the film adaptation.Out of curiosity for the accompanying story, I picked up this book from the library and opened it.Turks Delight turns out to be a novel that is difficult to pass a one-sided judgment on.Wolkers shows that filth and beauty need not be mutually exclusive.Not one of the 214 pages seems neat at first.Especially in the beginning, the bawdy synonyms, similes and metaphors spray around, but the story gradually matures in grace, to end in endearing emotional maturity in the last chapter. The violently contrasting writing style from flat to poetic and everything in between immediately hits and very pleasant to read.The nonchalance and coarse opinions of the first person sometimes let the age of the work seep through, but are mainly witty and real. Doubtful between three and four stars, but really it's just a beautiful book.And without this book, no soundtrack!Alright I finally finished this book and I gave it 1.5 out of five stars and I will explain why.Let's start with the writing.The writing didn't excite me at all.It was nothing special like people say it is.I found that a shame, because I really did want to like it.My biggest pet peave of this book was the story line.To me nothing really happened.I liked the characters, but the story was so slow!It irritated me so much!And at the end teh pacing changed and eveything went from zero to one-hundred real quick.So no, this was not the book for me.I read better romance books with sex in it.But I will say that I understand why people think it's good.But the last 15 to 20 pages were beautiful.I loved the grief and the acceptance of our main character.That I found beautiful.And the changes in Olga when she had left him.That is were my 1.5 stars are for.My Dutch is not very good and "Turks Delight" must have been the first book I read in this language.Even if I could only understand three thirds of the words, I still got it all.It is a wonderful and exciting book and it is written as if in a single day, from a fresh and pure feeling.Wolkers writes it as honestly as if he were only writing it for himself, and that is something strange and special.There seems to be no moral or lesson in it; it's a document of the fact that sometimes there are other forces at work in a relationship, and you're allowed to hold on to it, and it's okay to be sad about it, because it's all sad too, and it's a short life.Jan Wolkers speaks my literary language.This is like Dutch Bukowski but way less depressing than Bukowski.Wolkers displays his intense infatuation with women shamelessly.He is very clearly a pervert but exploits his own perversions in a way that is consistently colorful, fun, and jaw-dropping all at once.The book never slows down - it is a rollercoaster of lewdness, and in those rare moments where it shifts, it is a bit heartbreaking.It's raw, honest, and fully human.I read this because Turkish Delight is already one of my all time favorite films, but the book's voice speaks just as loudly as the film.I would say that this is also one of my favorite books now.Top 20, maybe Top 10.When I read the first chapters of this book, I remembered why my classmates talked so hysterically and giggly about this book about 7 years ago when I read it for my list.Oh yes, it was: Lots of sex. But I just love this story.The relationship, the love, not being able to let go of the ideal image of Olga despite her changing so much, the memories they went through... Reading this book a second time made me appreciate it again for what it is.So I can't give it less than 5 stars.I knew this was a classic Dutch book and film involving a fair amount of sex.I recently read a review of it here on Goodreads that told me that it’s definitely not a book I want to read.There is no category on here for books you don’t want to read, so I’ve made my own ‘shelf’ and added a couple of others for good measure.Incidentally, I also saw one of my friends lists this as one of her favourite books so perhaps one day I will be persuaded to read it, but that day will be a long way off.I would, however, like to read something by Jan Wolkers, it’s just a question of what.Okay, one thing, if you can't stand foul language, I wouldn't read this book.because hello, it started on the first page!!If you want to like this book, you really have to be able to read through that language.Then it is indeed a truly beautiful book about a man who tries to get over his lost love.I read it for my Dutch literature file, so that's going to be a very awkward oral lol.Yes how do you summarize this book?With the words: gross, explicit, vulgar but also intriguing. A love story like I've never read it before. I hadn't read this book before but heard about it so often and I thought I should read this sometime.I once took the book from my grandmother's bookcase. My thoughts when I finished reading the book were: Ok what should I think of this now. My thought after the first few pages: what the fuck am I reading.Didn't expect to like this book but I ended up adoring it.Very hard not to cry at the end.This is the most real, raw portrayal of non-romantic love I have ever encountered.I loved the balance of lust and true love.Even for a reread, what a blast, what a blissful piece of literature.Books like this will not and cannot be made today, there is no question about that.This is one I recommend to everyone.I had to read this book for school, and otherwise, I would not have read it.There were parts that just disgusted me, even though I am not a prudish person.I also did not like all the hate towards women, and how women were presented overall.Dutch Henry Miller?Strong ending.I didn't like the beginning, but more towards the end I started to like the story and also sad for the main character.How I found this disappointing.The negativity is dripping from it and even the beautiful moments are described very negatively and bare.I wasn't happy about it.reread and still beautiful A tragic but equally beautiful story The best book a man wrote about sensual love.good deserved sex Lots of sex i've read smut on wattpad with a better plot than this beautiful and unpredictable storyline, in general I didn't find the sex scenes disturbing, only some of them were described a bit too detailed for visual thinkers Horrible.I had to read this for school and I'm glad it's over.WARNING: lots of reminiscing ahead and so much not very helpful things if you're looking for reasons to read or not to read this book.I could probably find the specific year I read this but that would take too much effort.We had to pick and read a literary book by a Dutch author for school and I hated everything about that whole process.In my time there were not many short books to choose from and I think if a book was picked by a classmate you weren't allowed to choose the same book.But I could be misremembering that.I actually liked the class and learning the theory behind how stories are written, sentence structures etc.Got good grades and in the years before I just had to show how much I read (translated fiction) and in combination with my higher than the rest of the class grades meant I never had to read books from the 'Leeslijst'.Until the year(s) that lead up to taking exams.But even then I didn't hate the fact I had to read a book for class just that the books on the list were.... Well, read on.Choosing a book proved to be a challenge.Dutch literature and what we consider classics meant, and I still stand by this, that you could choose between book Doom, Gloom or Boring.I don't know why our literature mostly consistent out of gloomy books.We have a great sense of humour!Although I have to say I don't like the comedy books much, it feels whimsical and while I like that in Dutch poetry, not so much in fiction.Strange because I adore cabaret showsI picked Turk Fruit.Listen my reasons were totally superficial.I was promised some sexy times.I had a big mouth as a teenager and was really interested in Sex.As the totally awkward person I was back then, actually having it wasn't in my cards.So reading about it satisfied my curiosity somewhat.Thinking back now makes me cringe a bit, all my friends were 'late bloomers' so you can imagine how our conversations went...I do like that we never maliciously talked about the people who did have sex.We were a bit jelly but in general we also liked those people, we just didn't know how they did it.So innocent.But I had some good people as friends back then.Without them school would've sucked a so much more.Now I can't actually remember what the story was about because I felt Betrayed, Enraged and Bored throughout the story.Even to this day I still have some raging embers burning when this book comes up.Why you ask?The sex let me down.Big time.I can't actually remember how much was in it but I do remember being bored.I hate read that sucker but I thought at least I would get some titillating scenes!The reason why this book was considered so scandalous!Nope.Nothing.Zilch.Anything.Nothing at all.I got more out of Flowers in the Attic and I can still remember how horrified I was at that book.The worst part was that I wrote a book report on it and my teacher was surprised I was so negative about that book.They weren't used to that from me.So I had to talk about it.I can't remember what I said but I don't think I would have said something about the boring sex.I do remember being awkward about it.So yeah.If there is an book that can be considered my arch enemy then this is the one.It feels somewhat weird to give this 1 star after all these years so I'm not doing that but Teenage-Me would've given it so fast.Creative task: new ending (self-narrator) After Olga's failed marriages, she decides to pay me another visit.That didn't surprise me.No matter how far away she may live, how many times she will marry.She knows as well as I do that we are made for each other.She told me about her divorce and went back to her parents.I lay back in my bed, thinking about Olga as usual.I still don't know how it is possible that a woman can confuse me like that.I am still convinced that I want to build my life with her but I don't know how.Her mother hates me.According to her, I am still the poor sculptor who is not going to achieve much.She's so stubborn.She insists on a rich businessman for her daughter.As a sculptor I didn't earn much.But that was my passion so I was happy to continue.I was often lonely without Olga.No matter how far she may be she was always on my mind.I thought of her and put something together.It turned out to be a beautiful image.Not hard when Olga floats through my mind.I decided to put it up for sale.To my surprise, there were a number of interested people willing to spend a lot of money for my work.I took it to Olga's mother and showed her that a simple sculptor can also do a lot. She suddenly had a completely different opinion of me.She didn't care anymore that I was with Olga.All he cared about was the statue and the money.I found this really horrible.I took the statue and threw it on the floor.The image broke but I did not regret it.I looked at her and saw the surprise in her eyes.I said this is nothing compared to Olga.That material things are of no importance to me.That no money in the world can replace Olga.She was silent.I went to Olga's room and took her with me. After months we finally got married.Her mother always confused her.That's why she doesn't want kids either, but that didn't play a major role for me.As long as she is with me.---------------------------------------------------------- ------Biography:Jan Hendrik Wolkers was a Dutch writer, sculptor and painter.He was born on October 26, 1925 and died in his sleep on October 19, 2007.His parents came from Amsterdam and had eleven children, of whom Jan was the third.His school career was not a success.He had to drop out of school because of his bad grades.A little later he worked as an animal caretaker in a laboratory at Leiden University, he was also a gardener and a painter. He was not very successful in love either.John married three times.In 1947 he married Maria de Roo, In 1958 Wolkers married Annemarie Nauta and In 1963 he met Karina Gnirrep.In addition to novels, he also wrote many essays, novellas, plays, poems, diaries, letters, audio books and much more. He has written many novels, but he only really became known for his novels Turkish delight and Back to Oegstgeest.He has also won two awards.Including the Constantijn Huygens Prize (awarded 1982) and the P.C.Hooft Prize (1989).https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Wol...--------------------------- ---------------------------------------Jan Hendrik Wolkers, Turkish delight, Meulenhoff, Netherlands, 1969, 214p.I came across this novel after watching the famous movie, by Paul Verhoeven (one of my favourite directors) as I'd seen it on so many lists of the greatest movies and especially after I heard it was rated the greatest Dutch film of all time.The movie was very good and it was from the credits that I realised it was based on a novel by one of the Netherlands' favourite authors.So, knowing that the novel is almost always better than the movie, I ordered it from Amazon.I read it straight through which I only do for novels that really grip me.This one did -- and although I knew the basic plot from the movie -- (and it was nice to learn that the movie had been faithful to the book) -- as ever the novel had a lot more detail and filled in the characters much better.The novel is basically a story of the raw, passionate relationship between the narrator (unnamed), who is a sculptor and art student, and a middle-class girl called Olga.The story is told in the first person from the sculptor's point of view and is very graphic but beautifully written with great descriptive passages.Although he does not flinch from describing love-making in its all various ways, nor bodily functions and fluids -- the explicitness caused a bit of an uproar when it was first published in 1969 -- some people described it as 'disgusting' -- it is a very moving narrative of their relationship from first meeting during a stormy winter's day when he hitchhikes a ride from her, their first fuck in the car and the hilarious aftermath where he catches his penis in the zip of his fly, via the ups and downs of a modern relationship after she moves in, to the tragic ending.Mostly though the writing serves to show the reader how much he loved her and I liked it because it was realistic and shows the flaws in the main characters.The novel is almost entirely just about these two with the only other main characters being Olga's father and mother.I rarely get moved by books but this novel's ending -- even though I knew it already from the movie version -- still left a lump in my throat.It describes a kind of raw, passionate, dark, but all-consuming love which one would wish for even though it could not last.This novel is on the required reading list in the Netherlands for Dutch schoolchildren.From the beginning, this book turned out to be a Dutch, modern version of "Lady Chatterley's Lover" by DH Lawrence.I read through it 70% before I started seeing anything else.The narrator has simply talked about his sexual experiences with different people in an attempt to forget (or did he not want to forget) his lost love.In parallel, he told the story of their relationship and major events of their life together that eventually led to the end of their relationship. It was when Olga got into another marriage that things started to change.There seemed to be a change in the narrator.Then he became not just a frustrated and in love man, but actually a friend.They barely spoke during that relationship, but he wanted to make sure everything was okay with her, so he took a good look at her physical signs, and he didn't think it was a good relationship for her. With her third and final marriage to that American man he became even closer to her.She has sent postcards from all over the world, and through them he could see that she was unhappy.Then the marriage ended and she came back to the Netherlands...and she was sick. This is the moment where I really changed my opinion about the book.I thought the narrator's stories about his past with this woman were just sexual dreams and an attempt to return to better days.It was only when she got sick, and he dropped everything to support her--when her mother didn't even--I suddenly realized that he was actually in love with her all along. Because I saw the narrator's thoughts and how he coped with the changes I wasn't sad when Olga died.The man who loved her throughout the book was ready to let her go, so the readers were ready too. When I put the book down after finishing it, I didn't know what to think.At first I was annoyed with the book, then I understood why it had to be this way, and finally I felt sorry for the narrator.What can one really think about a book after going through all these thoughts?The old book by Jan Wolkers is about Olga, Erik's great love, who left him after he had slapped her.After that, Olga had a relationship with two other men, all of which also failed.Erik and Olga keep in regular contact by letter, in the end Erik often visits Olga in the hospital, where Olga is lying with a brain tumour.It gets worse and worse, and eventually she dies.The book will probably be very progressive and progressive in the context of that time, but now the content of the book is more food for conservative sexists.The book is written in I perspective, from Erik.He talked to Olga after the relationship had already ended.He couldn't go back home, so he stayed with her in the guest room.In the middle of the night he went to Olga's room to rape her.However, from his perspective it is justified.It also seems at first that Olga is happy with Erik, but in hindsight I think this was not the case.She was an object in Erik's hands.And that's it with this book.In those days, people often looked at women in this way, so that people did not think about it.In addition to sexism, many insulting remarks are made about people with a Black skin color and people with an intellectual disability.I am also not enthusiastic about the book itself: the sentences are very long, with many intermediate sentences that make you lose track.Many examples are used of people at that time, which no one understands today.I understand that at that time the book was on many bookshelves of progressive people, because the book is a lot about the free life, about life without God, but because people are now much more aware of racism and discrimination, it is not a progressive book more.As a result, the book has been ripped out of context, making it irrelevant to read.I read a book called ‘The Pisces’ by Melissa Broder last year, mostly on a bus from Toronto to New York City, and then in a stranger’s bed, alone, in an airbnb miles away from home.I think it’s important to mention this because the strangeness of my life at that time blended with the surrealism of the book and real life and book life became some ultimately stranger parallel universe where nothing made sense, and mermaid sex was possible, albeit extremely difficult.I need you to know this, because when I happened across a video of Broder recommending books, I felt like a voyeur.I demanded, no, I needed to peep into the mind that thought up ‘The Pisces’.In the short video, the first recommendation was Turkish Delight by Jan Wolkers, published in 1969.I was drawn by the cover; the font, the stark neon orange against black, the promises of the “juicy, hard and sensual.” Broder explains that she “because it’s full of longing and filth,” which she enjoys.Admittedly I’m the same.I like smut; bedsheets and bathroom stalls and park benches at night and all of that.My only condition is that my smut must contain truth.It must wrack my brain and break my heart.Turkish Delight is the story of a love affair between an unnamed narrator, a sculptor and his redheaded love Olga.Their love begins with a car wreck, and ends just as magnificently.What the book lacks in plot, it makes up for in a brutal honesty, a painting of art, life, and love from someone with an aggressively insatiable lust, full of rage, and jealousy.While some of the book may prove problematic for some, I found it enjoyably explicit and complicated.It is a love story between Eric and Olga.A relationship that manifested itself in one fell swoop and its roots nestled deep in the earth.It's an unbreakable love at first sight.The woman of his life, his Olga, who turned his life upside down.Who made him a man of love instead of the contemptuous woman objectifying sexist that he was.Unfortunately, he was still a man who was full of himself and thought he could make up for everything with a game of sex.Well, no. Anyway, both characters weren't very likeable.Eric is actually a typical man in the sixties, contemptuous of women, a big ego and slightly racist.Eventually my sympathy for him grew.His love (or obsession) for her always remained strong in his heart.She stole his heart and he never asked her back.It was all hers, with pleasure.Olga, on the other hand, is portrayed as an unstable woman who cannot be happy.She cannot make her own choices and lives according to the standard ideal: home, tree, animal.At least that's what she wanted.Outside of being "a woman for the man," she didn't know how to live her own life in freedom.All in all an okay book, nothing special about the story itself.The pages were all rags of text, nowhere paragraphs to breathe.The sentences were sometimes a bit too long-winded and tiring in the long run.I did think he could describe certain things very nicely; especially when he talked about Olga, his great love.Where do I even begin.... The only word that comes to mind is 'traumatized'.I read the first 3 pages of this book in the school auditorium and felt like I had committed a sin.I can handle 'bad' things well, gory images in school books and films often do nothing for me.But the fact that this book is on the book list really baffles me.Besides the way he tells graphically about his sex parties and about the bodies of the participants, there are also just weird scenes that make me wonder why he wrote this. At such moments I remember that this book was not written yesterday. and published.It was super taboo at the time to talk about these topics and especially the way he talks about them.Because of this I can still see the 'positive' in this book.There's a lot of misogyny in it, I don't think there was one time he mentioned a woman without involving her body.Positive or negative.Or maybe I couldn't remember those parts because of how intense the rest were. Although this book took away some of my innocence, I got super emotional at the end.It wasn't anything new or original, but it still really touched me because there was quite a contrast in how he talked about Olga throughout the book versus how he talked about her at the end.Also, the contrast between how long he wrote about certain periods in his life was quite remarkable and that made for a very nice effect towards the end.Will never read this again in my life.Review Turkish delight Written by Jan WolkersPersonally, this is not my book, I think that no respect is shown to women in the way Jan Wolkers expresses things.He takes down the pride of being a woman in this book.The many intimate moments make me a little uncomfortable, it is written in such detail that it becomes very intense.The I person loves Olga very much, but at the same time also pretends that Olga is an object.He shows disrespect to women.The two different ways of dealing with women is very contradictory, making it a bit of a vague book.On the other hand, I really like the writing style.Despite the fact that he is somewhat misogynistic in this book, he writes very directly.He certainly doesn't have a leaf for his mouth.I like this style of writing, it is nice and direct and there is no extensive story around it.This is easy to read and makes the book a lot clearer.When this book was published in 1969, the Netherlands was shocked.Never before has love, sex and death been described in this way.Now that I am reading this book in 2019, I am still a little shocked. I would describe this book as special, some people find it wonderful to read.I can understand this.But I personally don't like reading it.The beginning of the book is... different from other books.Lots of sex: crude, yet described with love.I'm not used to those kinds of books and actually thought it was funny.Describe sex that way.I read that some thought it pornographic, but it is not told really exciting: it just happens, it is the events, the facts.I liked that style.After that, the story gets a bit more gloomy, boring and long-winded.Still interesting enough to read on, because I wanted to know how he would fare.The last part is very beautiful and all the gore is long gone.I thought it was a beautiful love story with completely crooked proportions.You can feel the real love, despite the main character's limited gaze and limited empathy.I liked that the image I know from the city of Groningen (Woman with cat), which I like but had never really thought about, is described in this book, so that it now has meaning.I myself found the book a bit confusing - especially at the beginning - because it is written in a non-chronological order.The author regularly uses flashbacks to help you understand the story better.They also provide curiosity.This makes the book quick and easy to read.Those flashbacks help you answer the questions you ask yourself. The author is certainly not afraid to describe things in the story in a 'crude' way, which I personally don't like to read.Certainly in the beginning of the book things were described dirty, where I was reading with raised eyebrows.Things were described in detail and in detail, which made for a slightly uncomfortable reading experience. Towards the end of the story, you especially feel sorry for the main character and Olga. It is a very realistic book, which certainly contains a story.Well, look, what shall we say about it. In the zeitgeist, I understand very well that this book has kicked against many taboos.Just mentioning the word "cancer" was unusual and you really didn't. In my high school I made it a point not to like this book because people in class only started reading it for sex and tits and that made me feel uncomfortable. Were there too many cocks and jerks in it?Did I find Eric's slut period particularly disrespectful and misogynistic?Absolute.Definitely.Did I like it better than I initially thought and do I understand why this is seen as a classic?That, too. The love was raw and honest and tough, no punches were thrown at the seams, and the book was so real at times it made you feel uncomfortable, which I think was the point. I'm glad I read it .Initially, I really hated this book.The narrator was vulgar and rambling incessantly to the point where I swear I had a migraine.He was clearly madly in love, so much so that his vilest descriptions still turned out somewhat tender??But this was probably intentional, the writing does a great job of portraying a stuck-up eccentric artist obsessively in love/lust and the narrator’s emotions come through really well through all his anecdotes.The story develops really well and I finished the book feeling sad and empty (just like the narrator).The fact that the narrator conveys his life story in context of his love interest and all his reactions as a result of her is a testament to how in love he was.In summary, this book is crazy and slightly revolting but also raw and unique.Very controversial but worth reading.Although the reader has to struggle through a good dose of explicit sex, Olga and Eric's story is mainly about love, death and loss.The influence of family and parents (in-law) plays a major role.The writer places a number of contradictions in the story such as poor-rich, beautiful-ugly, father-in-law (friendly)-mother-in-law (witch), capital-small town.The religious knowledge can also be read back from the Reformed background of the writer. In the end, all emotions come into their own when the main character knows who/what he has lost.Quotes:- 'Whatever you have done, whatever you do or will do, wherever you go, I will always love you'- 'I put my hand on her damp cheek and pressed her head against me' I got there very difficult because the main character is quite rude.I understand that it was new to write about sex for that time, but I found the nasty descriptions especially about women's bodies too much and it didn't add much to the story for me.So in the beginning I wanted to stop several times.Fortunately, I persevered, because underneath all that description slowly came a really beautiful and sincere love story.Wolkers draws nice parallels and it is nice to read good Dutch descriptions and words again after many English books. Many events are a bit outdated, given me too etc, sometimes it was for the course of the story, but if the main character it was seen as normal.This is a very different romance novel from the one we are used to, which explains with all its clarity even details that will sometimes disturb and even nauseate.A talented but penniless, daring artist, he meets Olga, a chubby, red-haired beauty, one day while hitchhiking.Despite being penniless and destitute, they share joyous days with records, gins, walks, animals found on the street and brought home, and lots of sex.Then things change.The man who tells the story is not even mentioned in the novel, except that he is a sculptor and painter.This is the story of a man loving a woman enough to see life completely through his eyes.4 very unexpected stars Reluctantly picked up this book because of a book club and the first sentence immediately showed why I didn't even want to give this book a chance.Halfway through my only thought was 'must persevere'.. But suddenly there is not a raunchy sex scene hidden in every paragraph and the love story gets depth and I start to empathize with the characters.All in all, the (in my view unsavory) descriptive sexual content of this book was fine.What remains is an intriguing love story that makes you look beyond your first impression.I can well understand why Wolkers has raked together so much controversy with this book.Now, more than 50 years later, it has not lost its edge.It's a raw, personal read about a nymphomaniac artist who describes his relationship - and especially the aftermath of it - with the love of his life.He doesn't beat around the bush: he's rotten and going through deep valleys, desperately trying to get her back.The sex is nice and dirty and borders on nauseating.Only the male-female ratios in the book have not always remained tenable today.Four stars.At the beginning of the book, the fact that the author writes so openly and unprofessionally really bothered me, but even when I was uncomfortable, the curiosity to know the character, what he was going through and what would happen next kept the book going.The reader made me smile when he told about the author's language that I said I was comfortable with for sexuality, the fine details and the sides that people don't want to show most of the time.As you continue with the book, seeing traces of the past traumatic experiences of the characters being in this state today makes you understand the characters better.In short, a gripping mini-novel that can be read quickly and easily.Truly a classic of Dutch literature.The dissolute artist, who acts as narrator, falls boundlessly in love with Olga.In the beginning everything revolves around sex and together they are very happy.But over time, Olga feels increasingly unhappy and happily looks for her elsewhere.The narrator mainly blames her mother for this, as she prefers Olga to build a stable relationship with financial security.The path to happiness is not a bed of roses for Olga.And the narrator, who is still in love, sees everything with sorrow.Actually "Turkish Delight" by Jan Volkers, translated version of above book.Story of a Dutch artist who meets the love of his life, Olga...the BEAUTIFUL Olga.He becomes so obsessed with her in his life.Even when she leaves...and comes back...and leaves.He never forgets her.Written in wildly almost hilarious erotic words, it can be quite humorous.And for all the sexuality &amp; crazy living, the book ends in a rather sad way.The whole story is equally loving &amp; disturbing at the same time.I almost want to say that this is a true story, a part of the author's life.Yes, I am that old that I read this book in 1975 for my final list.And at that time the movie was very popular so you had to be careful that you could explain the differences between movie and book.Because there were definitely differences and the teacher definitely asked about that.For me it was on the one hand an erotic and exciting book that we all read with red ears.But on the other hand, I was also impressed by the pain described in the book.And what sadness can do to you.I don't think I've ever been this confused while reading a book.Starting it, I was at the verge of dnf'ing it and giving it 1 star, whereas now after finishing it I'm a crying mess.After about 100 pages this book took a dramatic turn and I was hooked.I would've rated this book 5 stars and added it to my favorites list if it wasn't for the hardcore porn in the beginning.That bugged the hell out of me and really put me off.Nevertheless, the other 50% of this book was great.I don't think I would've ever imagined me saying that but...it's true.It is very logical that the book belongs to the literary canon of the Netherlands.I am not sensitive to 'classics' and read it without expectations.First hundred pages especially a bit overwhelmed by the visual (!!!)scenes.But beneath the surface lurks one of the most extraordinary love stories I've ever read.For the first time in a long time really sad again because of the ending.Language felt like art while reading.Read 30 books so far in 2020, of which this one is definitely one of my favorites.I first read this book in Dutch at a very young age.I didn’t appreciate it then.This time however was much different for me.This book is full of emotion and very descriptive.I could feel the love and the pain of loss right along with him.Sure there is sex and lots of it but what got me is the details on how he felt about Olga and what his life was like with her and without her.There are a couple of moments where his hate for her mother is mentioned in ways that would be offensive to some people and I could have done without .4.5 stars I read the book in one day.What a great story.The writing style is different from what I usually read.The story is told from the main character's point of view, from his memories.It takes some getting used to at first, but after that you become incredibly engrossed in his thoughts, feelings and experiences.Sex, drama, romance and a heartbreaking twist at the end.A must!I'm not sure.. 3 or 4 stars.Read for the book club with school of life. In any case, it is all very graphically described, mainly sex, but actually everything.That is not necessarily something negative, but sometimes I found it a bit too much.It is of course a classic so yes, can you think something of that ;)?In the end I liked the story, but I could have had more depth in it, in exchange for less sex.I felt there was more to get out of it.Blatantly grotesque and obscene at first, extremely sad at the end.A book that was a roller coaster full of emotions; disgust, anger, sadness, and a lot of laughter for all the totally absurd scenes.The plot follows a couple before, during and after their relationship.The author writes excellent.First book I read by a Dutch author and 10/10.I recommend it especially for those who have read Kundera and liked it.I do strongly believe that Jan Wolkers' work on Turks Fruit is sublime.A rugged, post-war fuming pot of anger and violence twisted by the beautiful Dutch language in all its raw fleeting, blue, red, bombastic emotions.It has a rhythm a sort of unique beat.The journey of the protagonist Eric colors the world deeply by his own vision, the world he lives in really reflecting parts of himself.A book that will make you laugh, frown and tear up.Well written in large parts, hello syntax, an amount of tits, ass and cunt that would make an average fifteen-year-old hard-on, but I'm not particularly excited about now (and probably not then).It is then saved, because there is something to laugh about and the love story still has a sensitive ending.OVERRATED.Meh.Lots of sex, lots of passion, lots of love.But yeah, I can't say more than that about this book.It was a good read, but I thought it was pretty casual about things like rape and violence.The writing style appealed to me at times, but at other times it hit the nail just wrong.Turkish delightFirst thought this is a heavy book.It was once on my school reading list that's why I bought it once.It's a bit rotten to read and I think it's supposed to make you feel uncomfortable.Yummy thin book. Not feminist, sex is talked about rudely. Interesting from start to finish.If you've read Norwegian Wood and want to feel the same kind of feel, this is it.At first it's all sexed up and some of you may find it objectifying but in context, this is a 1960s novel with a male gaze.But as you read along it's really about young love and how things change over time.It's just...sad.Look beyond the sex and you will see longing and loss.Masterful.At first glance, the sexual theme seemed somewhat banal due to the rather raw and raw descriptions of the sex, but juxtaposing those passages with the deeper emotional parts creates a wonderful interplay of carnal and psychological love/dependence.Written in a Wolkers-like style, making it easy to read.Full of detailed descriptions of body, nature and environment, which I always enjoy very much.Despite the fact that the book is full of gross sexual excesses, I found it a very sensitive book.The main character's love is hungry, but also tender and it describes the desolation of a faded or faded love.I don't remember much of what I actually thought of this book, since I read it about 3 to 4 years ago.However, I do remember it was a book somewhat uncomfortable but also enjoyable to read.Definitely recommend everyone to at least have read it once in their life, as long as you're aware that it contains quite a lot of sex scenes, and you are okay with that.The book is 150 pages.Until page 120 I thought "this is really going to be 1 star".It was quite misogynistic for my feeling and also beastly or something.Until the end came.And it became very clear how "weird" he really loves her.Also this guy had 5 years of heartbreak where he fucked another person every day which made me feel less bad about myself really super vulgar book, the sex scenes are super sickening.also the relationship is anything but romantic and I felt sorry for Olga throughout the book.it's impossible to like the main character because he just does one fucked up thing after another.only towards the end did I start to find the book somewhat okay because at least he comes across as human. Still a gripping book after so much time.You will not find a more witty description of the intertwining of passion, physicality, horror and death.There are few authors in Dutch literature who can match this feat of Wolkers in that respect.The very last book on the required reading list Literature of the 20th century for my education and I really couldn't get through it.I understand that this book made a huge impact when it came out, but it's just not for me.wonder how this would have been received if it was written now, from the perspective of a woman or written by a woman and not a straight white man.either way - entertaining and interesting book that holds up even though there's no plot.I'm not super prudish, but this novel went a bit too far at times.Perhaps the fact that I read it as an audiobook, read by Wolkers himself, was not the best choice for a book with so much raunchy talk.By the way, it's a really good story.The book tells a great love/life story in a lot of details which can be both shocking and funny.Very well written, speaks to your imagination and emotions.Great descriptions of scenes, animals and nature.One of my favorite Dutch novels  School of life de online boekenclub was de reden om het te lezen.Sweet, beautiful, funny told from a beautiful perspective.Now when it rains again I think of the fish.It rained so hard that the fish didn't even notice they were being caught.Too carnal.I suspect she would have liked it in other contexts as a teenager.Now the human drama, the depth of the relationship is gone.However, the author is also interesting in the 1973 book of the same name. I would like to find the movie.when I read it I didn't like the story, now I didn't know why but when I did some more research after reading it I discovered that this book is not about sex but about rape, if you are going to read it, check it out at that way and interesting to read.A classic I picked up at the thrift store for 50 cents somewhere.Some kind of school edition.I couldn't care less.Excessive sex in books rarely appeals to me.I am in favor of the style in itself, but I did not feel the great love between those 2.much love to my man jan!what a quick and dirty read—i love the fast paced, bohemian-casual way this is written (english translation).totally felt like id been transported into the sculptor narrator's fuzzy, love-tinged brain and it was a fun ride, all the way to the bitter end 🖤 havo / vwo superstructure - boys / girls - an ironic and tragic love story in which sex is central.found the book uncomfortable to read at first, but later it becomes a romantic story that is easy to read.I considered not finishing this and expected it to be my way into a reading slump, but once past the halfway point, something shifted and it turned out to be such a good piece.I left with teary eyes and goosebumps.Big appreciation for Wolkers’ writing.What a great story this book has all the emotions and feelings you can imagine.I found in the thrift store in the bible belt under Rotterdam, which makes the book even better.Unconditional love no longer exists.Quick to read.Good story.Unfortunately a lot of foul language and a lot of sex, but that's what you get with Dutch literature... Rereading.Energy and zest for life, but also decay and care Nice story, although the details were sometimes about it.Enjoyed reading it at the time.Crude, shocking, gross, sometimes funny, sometimes sad...a total guilty pleasure to read!4.5 This book is so dear!!A very earnest rendering of the course of an ordinary love life cast in the eyes of two artistic and careworn humans.Raunchy and funny and genuine.It's just not my thing.I couldn't stand the main character so that also makes it less read. Well, is this the book that everyone has always told me so horrified about? Yes, there are some dirty scenes but that aside it's a very nice story and special finely written.Taboo breaking, art A classic, but maybe a bit dated? I also don't know if the large amount of rudeness contributes enormously to the book.... Love love love Utter crap.Unreadable.Dramatically sad, strange, way too much sex, towards cynicism, a strange main character and the ending leaves you defeated. Great book.Simply beautiful story and sometimes secretly a little sad.Liefde, kanker this book was (at times) disgusting, disturbing, vulgar... but, it was also very beautiful.a tragic love story that is not for the faint of heart, but absolutely worth the read 4.5 stars  Wel gezien nooit gelezen.Bite through at the end it will be very nice.Delicious!You have to get through the little weird and some vulgar scenes, but it is a good and enjoyable book Raunchy, but heartbreakingly weird book, read for school.the writing style was interesting, easy to read through.From vulgar to pathetic to poignant.Ugh.At least it was short.One more star for the end.(That Olga has no character, you just read how he sees her.Who she really is?Puzzle.)Terribly sad and beautiful 3.5 Very nice book with many comic parts.A man with a very sexist life.In terms of emotional life, the most Dutch book I've ever read.A book that really surprised me.The writing style is great.You have to laugh a lot in the book and the sadness of the book comes in all the harder.A classic that I recommend to everyone.I'm not sure what I think about it, it's very flat and maybe a bit unnecessarily graphic, but it's also an impressive story that I read in one day.Nice, but the latest is finished.Unfortunately of things is Classic.The movie was fun 80 pages of greasiness, 120 pages of Nobel Prize literature!Interesting from the opposition of animal vs. human, but otherwise not really my thing.Wolkers’ style of writing puts you right inside the head of the main character.Beautifully but graphically written- especially if you think in images.Dutch classic about love, love, love, breaking up and sex, with a beautiful, unexpected, touching loving ending.Standing ovation.WHAT a love ❤️ Beautifully written.Read again for the school of life book club next month.Now enjoy how the story is told.A fallible protagonist and his phallocentric ramblings...make for a good read!2.7 howl Beautiful drama, passionately written.But not exciting.very misogynistic Whirlwind So sad, with her wig and the loose teeth.Last chapter suddenly very pathetic.I just didn't cry Pure, horrible, romantic and sad story.Loved it Superficially: sex sexAnd that is also true, but in my opinion it is also very much about loneliness, pushed away insecurity/sensitivity and toxic relationships.4.5 dnf Was a bit difficult to finish.Not because it was hard to read, but because I low-key hate the narrator/main character.Written less lively and frivolous than, for example, summer heat.More seriously, but that doesn't make it better.The last 2 chapters are especially strong.WHY, why did Olga have to die¿¿ 🥺 Come on, a very good book.not really fun because had to be for a literary talk show with Dutch 👎 sad and stuff Really traumatized by the explicit scenes in this book another summer favorite.beautiful, honest story telling you shouldn't use salad oil as a lubricant then you'll all get fungi Why isn't the whole book like the last chapter?Read for my list for 1978.I had six Jan Wolkers books on my list of 40.I thought it was pretty candid at the time.A very basic story.Very easy to read, but not my thing.50 shades of gray has nothing to do with it.Funny, shocking, beautiful, compelling, beautiful imagery.A bit needlessly explicit at times (going for schock value), but overall a very beautiful story of lost love and how deep nostalgia can cut into a person.Raw and captivating story about passionate love, grief and death.Nice nl literature a lot of smut old man High manic pixie dream girl content but very well written and a gripping story Hardcore sex but secretly still literature Better than I expected.Each sentence is a small work of art.A story about how a soul-devouring overwhelming love that means the end.A book that makes little difference between the past and the present.This makes it quickly unreadable and often incomprehensible. One of the better Dutch literature books I've read so far. It remains literature.So not my thing.But it was a more interesting and fun book than I expected!3,5??Different from what I had imagined All time fave despite and because of rancidity A bit vulgar perhaps, but otherwise so beautifully written with beautiful words and sentences and a touching story.Touching.Brilliant passages with humor and filth.Wolkers leaves you with an impressive, melancholic ending.What started out as a pathetic oversex story ended up as a... Even more pathetic story....and well.Poorly written sex with a love interest written as a child.Nothing is deep or anything, except the main charcter's peemple in someone.if he didn't justify that r*pe and the ending wasn't so abrupt Okay hear me out I know it's a bit weird but like loved this book.Was crazy.. but like crazy horny or something?Thought it was a cute love story but maybe that says more about me I guess.Finished it in two days which is crazy for me dirty. 189 pages of goop "She kept crying hysterically and I told her to stop.But she couldn't stop it on her own.She held up her face and told me to hit her.Then it was over.She said it was something from the past.That I couldn't understand.I immediately hit her hard on her wet cheeks.When she still didn't stop I threw her on the bed, pulled up her skirt, pulled down her panties and hit her hard with the flat of my hand on her buttocks.Until her skin was red and swollen and that buttocks looked awfully hot."OK--this book is NOT big in the America--I had never heard of it &amp; it is EXACTLY in my wheel house.And I loved it--which should come as no surprise to anyone.A fun well written unique work of fiction.Seriously, there is a mind boggling brilliant twist in this that changes everything and guarantees it will always remain a global classic.Highly recommended to everyone--particularly if you read &amp; loved all the standard undergrad hippy lit.Jan Wolkers review to come soon!👀👀👀 For school I had to write a review for this.So if you have a moment :) My review contains minor spoilers so if you haven't read the book yet, you better stop here. Sugary sweet love When the I-person of Olga, a beautiful red-haired woman, gets into the car during the hitchhiking, the spark immediately flies.The tension mounts and eventually they end up on the side of the road.After the car ride, the I-person can't get Olga out of his head so he tries to visit her.They fall in love but love so sweet can never last long.In this novel, Jan Wolkers (1925-2007) clearly rebels against his strictly Reformed past by writing this very visual novel.Moreover, there are also autobiographical elements in the story, for example Jan Wolkers himself studied sculpture and the first person of the story is also a sculptor.The theme of "Turkish Delight" is the loss of a loved one.The theme has been developed very extensively.The first person suffers a great loss, but smaller losses also play a role throughout the story.Love and death, but also sexuality and loneliness are important motifs.The first person loves Olga unconditionally and cannot let her go.Death also appears frequently in the book.For example, Olga's father dies and the shelduck to which Olga is very attached also dies.Sexuality is very important in the life of the first person and the book also describes very graphically how he has sex with Olga.The loneliness in which the first person ends up when Olga leaves him is also described in detail.Jan Wolker certainly does not mince words in this novel.The sex that the first person has with Olga is described in such a taboo way that it makes you uncomfortable, but somehow it fits the story.The directness of Jan Wolkers' writing style is what makes the book special, love hurts and that should be clear.Wolkers' writing style is coarse, beastly, intense and ruthless, but very honest.Certainly for that time, this lack of taboo was very special and many people were not served by it.The characters in the book are very human, which makes the story feel very realistic.The I-character has a great contrast in his character.On the one hand he loves Olga intensely and carries her on his hands, but on the other hand he is extremely misogynistic and sometimes it seems as if he almost sees Olga as an object.Olga is also described from two sides.The first-person tells on the one hand how clumsy, chubby and stubborn she is, but on the other hand he praises her and can't stop talking about how perfect she is.The contradictions in the characters of the characters make the book just that little bit more believable.Both 'Turkish Delight' and 'The Golden Egg' are themed around the loss of a loved one.In both books, however, this theme is developed completely differently.For example, the first person in 'Turkish Delight' breaks down completely when Olga leaves him, but Rex, the protagonist of 'The Golden Egg', picks up after his wife, Saskia, disappears and his life starts again.I think the word 'special' best describes the book 'Turkish Delight'.The story is cruel but also very beautiful.It is definitely recommended if you can handle some dirt and want to read a good book, but if you get uncomfortable hearing about flowers and bees, you better ignore this book.The vulgarity of the language and the aggression almost put me off.Glad i continued to read it, the narrative cooly shifts us from a lusty honeymoon phase between the young couple to an agape love for a pair who’s connection withstands the obstacles of life’s natural discourse.When a love relationship comes to an end, women and men behave differently. Some cry and hurt themselves, some withdraw into solitude, and some rush from adventure to adventure, as if sex alone will make up for the "deficit" of love and the departure of a loved one. .This is exactly how this book begins, in which the writer describes the departure of his beloved and dear Olga, and his trips and sexual adventures with other women.But that's just the beginning.Later (if you can stand the beginning of the book and if you don't mind descriptions of explicit sex), the book becomes very interesting, I would say that it contains all the essence of a passionate, turbulent and sensual love. The story of a sculptor, an artist, who, in his own way, the artistic way describes the wild, unbridled love with the beautiful, sensual Olga, which grows into obsessive sexuality, into wild and unbridled living and celebrating love while it existed and existed in them.I was deeply impressed by the story, because "scratching" under the surface, I came to the conclusion that regardless of all the descriptions and sexual stunts of the main protagonists, there is something sublime, and that is love, which is the main driver of this story. I was fascinated by the verse through which He passes by, giving himself and describing his boundless love and obsession with women.And when at the end it was no more.And when she left.And when she no longer wanted to reconcile with him, he loved her.He loved her even when she got sick, he loved her even when she wasn't what she used to be, when none of her beauty was left.Only photos and memories that it was her.He loved her and couldn't help it."Whatever you do, whatever you do or will do, wherever you go, I will always love you!"I was not interested in how they make love, but I was interested in the very way of seeing the pain of love that the main protagonist of the novel goes through. Looking from my point of view, nothing surprised me in this story.We are all slaves to our emotions and sexuality, some more and some less.Of course, some people will never admit it to themselves, let alone to others.What I liked in the book is precisely the love that, from a man's point of view, is not romantic, but sincere, driven by passion and extraordinary strength and perseverance.While reading the novel, I wondered what it would look like if she had written it?Would there be such scenes then, or would it all be camouflaged with romance and hidden sexuality?I think it would, because we women look at love, passion and sex in a completely different way. This book is not for everyone.I also think that it does not have an average rating.You either love her or you don't, you either liked her or repulsed her.I liked it, and a big recommendation from me!This book was overtly sexual, to the point of being grotesque, and at times it was hard to read.It was so interesting to read a book about love which didn't focus at all on love- Olga is an object of fantasy, of sexual desire, but at no point does there seem to be a base level of love and respect.Even from their first meeting the couple are sexual, which makes you wonder what was going on in Wolker's head.This is a fascinating piece of Dutch literature, and I am glad that I had to study it for class.It opened my eyes to the ways the sexual liberation movement influenced Dutch society, and has changed the way I look at Dutch culture now.I do wonder if my enjoyment of the book was somewhat influenced by the fact that I studied it; being able to have conversations about deeper meanings and contexts really opened my eyes to the significance of certain scenes.Does this book live up to modern standards of sexuality and consent?No, but it is interesting to see how Dutch literature has evolved.“They were studying art history, and they had fixed maxims on the wall, between a reproduction of Memling’s Mystical Lamb and the inevitable self-portrait of the madman of Arles with the bandaged head.THERE’S NOTHING SADDER THAN ASSOCIATIONS HELD TOGETHER BY NOTHING BUT THE GLUE OF POSTAGE STAMPS.Et : ONE WHO PUTS SALT IN THE SUGAR BOWL IS A MISANTHROPE.“Looking engrossed, they plunged their American trumpet noses into their books.“A chubby guy with close-cropped hair and teddy bear-like appearance, but with clear, mean eyes.“Panel, bohemian American students traveling the world on scholarships not enough to live on, but enough not to die.“Again, like a pudding during a bombardment, he quivered for a long time with laughter.“Artists are uncritical guzzlers.""Auntie's skin was strewn with freckles like the asphalt of New York's Fifth Avenue was confetti after a fashion show""She has large incisors that dig into her lower lip when she speaks .“I was kicking my sword in the water.There was no way to fight his fear with reasoning.“She looked borrowed.Like a colored photo.““face still swollen with sleep” “My father used to pretend that Americans were not a civilized people."For I imagined Olga, her hair as long as Botticelli's Venus, floating in a glassy clarity.As pretty as ever.»Les délices de Turquie – Jan Wolkers It is always a question of waiting to see what the test of time has done to a classic, especially if you read it for the first time decades later.And especially if such a classic has become a classic because the book must have been innovative and taboo-breaking 'in its time'.Turks Delight remained intact as far as I'm concerned as a beautiful representation of a fierce and fatal history, but imagine that a little more. sharper books such as De Oesters van Nam Kee and Vals Licht have taken their inspiration from this, then I read these books in the wrong order for the sake of historical awareness. Interesting was that now for once the male protagonist is not clearly a loser, but someone of whom you notice quite subtly that he also has no idea how to take care of women (or animals, or himself).I found the lack of tension less; the many preludes constantly reminded you that you were reading a love story with a fatal ending, so as a reader I never "bonded" with the couple.I understand that this was a huge sensation when it was published in 1969, but this level of sexual detail and dark humor has become quite normal for novellas about early adulthood.I can't really comment on the writing itself, since the English translation was from 1974.I just saw on Amazon that a new English translation is being published in early 2017, however.But I don't think I will bother looking at it.You have to slog through a lot of hedonism to get to an emotionally resonant ending in the last nine pages.Still, it's a pretty short book, only 158 pages, so it should not feel like a huge commitment.Somehow, it did feel like something I needed to finish rather than wanted to finish.There were many astute comments on middle-class morality, and just a wry, grubby humor in general.The narrator is impossible not to love (sort of a John Fante type), but there wasn't a huge forward momentum since the narrator is passive in many ways.As I expected, there were indeed a lot of sex scenes.Because of this I actually thought that I wouldn't find the book interesting at all and that it was kind of a no-nonsense book.But I was very wrong about that, because after reading the book I thought that Jan Wolkers can write very beautifully.What I didn't expect at all was that Olga dies, because of the way Jan Wolkers wrote it seemed as if Olga and the first person would just split up.Whatever happens but later Olga also dies and I really didn't expect that.Also because the first person always talked about the fact that she had left him.The book took an unexpected turn for me at the end.This was very nicely described in the book and I think a big compliment to the author.It's about a special relationship and how you can grow apart like that.Turks delight, the heartbreaking story of a passionate love, originally appeared in 1969 and caused a shock in Dutch literature.Never before have Love, Sex and Death been forged into such a pulsating and vital whole.Review(s) The tragicomic episodes in this autobiographical novel, full of eroticism, death and misery, arise from the relationship of the narrator, a visual artist, with the woman who left him.This wild, brutal, lively and at times shy, sensitively written novel is one of Jan Wolker's best.Due to the very successful film adaptation, this book received even more publicity.Cheap reprint.Generous lettering, full page layout.(Biblion recensie, Redactie) (source: Bol.com) Two young people in love, so in love that they even get married, who are very poor, she without a job, he a sculptor, what will they occupy their time with?In copulating without fainting.The first half of the novel goes into that question of orifices, but without anything making him think of a moment of jealousy he hits her, Olga goes back to her mother's house and they divorce.Several years pass in which from time to time he finds out about Olga's life.In the end they are together again -in another way- but I don't tell more. The strange thing is that the characters are not defined at all, nor is it related how love is born, nor how it goes away. Despite these absences, the book convinces.There are many circumstantial anecdotes that may hold the key.Joy and sadness reach the reader in some way.It was better than I thought, this book.The book is quite well-known in the Netherlands because of the fact that it was quite shocking when it came out; the descriptions of sex are pretty explicit, the language is sometimes kind of vulgar, and Wolkers isn't afraid of describing some pretty nasty things.But I think all of these things make the subject what the story is really about - an unhappy love - even more vulnerable and moving.The book contains some romantic and tender parts (like kissing and drinking wine in the rain, outside, on the sidewalk), and the end is tragic - very well displayed in the thoughts and feelings of the protagonist.Where many people only have an eye for the banal, sexual and coarse beginning, I mainly have an eye for what follows.A harrowing and compelling story about love at first sight, about finding the love of your life.But also about loss.Slowly losing grip and eventually having to let go.With the arrival of the assassin (cancer) at the end, I automatically had to think of the well-known book by Kluun. All in all, I thought it was a beautiful book.I can identify with people who experience sexuality as banal.Wolkers shows that no beautiful, poetic language is needed to express love.Physical and mental love.That is also an art in itself.Sex does indeed play a major role in the book, but it fits with it.The whole story is told honestly and raw.I read it on vacation and finished it in 2 days, it reads smoothly.Afterwards I didn't have a 'wow feeling', but just a nice book.You should also realize that the themes in this book were groundbreaking at the time it was published.People were shocked.That this could be written and even published!However, now that we consider these themes and writing style normal, for some people that takes the special layer off the book.But there's still plenty left.Full of shocking and extremely sexual passages, but certainly not without use.The book is a beautiful description of an insane love that fits very well with the zeitgeist but is also timeless because Wolkers understands very well what instinctive human behavior is.The book is full of wonderful details and observations of how people are and act.Of how insane a person can become in love and of how bizarre a human life can turn out.Timeless classic that deserves endless re-reading.Beautiful, strong visual language, but with all his love for Olga, the main character still comes across as if her thought life does not interest him at all.O.a.that he raped her during the divorce, and that it's a pretty good point that she's never been in town on her own in all those six years.The ending, where she falls back on him after her brain tumor, shrinks her and invalidates her good arguments like the gibberish of a sick person; that is emotional abuse.A story about love.Love as a feeling, emotion, more than falling in love or loving. The author did everything to convince the reader of the sincerity with which the main character loves Olga.Do not be put off by the explicitly described sexual acts, because that is necessary to experience the passion and pain.The details are beautiful, the broad strokes sad.Anyone who surrenders to this book will have a very special experience.At least that's my own experience.Bouncing with hormones, in the eighties I was hardly able to read Turkish Delight other than as glorified porn, the story was lost in the hunger for 'carnal' passages.What a relief to read it now in its entirety and to discover that the many foul-mouthed, uncensored anecdotes are the features of an emerging zeitgeist and of a great writing talent.Turkish Delight is a beautiful, unique variation on the archetypal story about love, loss and death.With an unbridled sad ending and the lived life as consolation.why the fack are they making me read this book for a cancer lesson when it's only in the last facking SEVEN pages of this nearly 200 page long book that someone gets cancer??!?!?WHY??!!?While we're still thinking "WHY??!!?"- why did Jan Wolkers think that this book would be improved by completely filling it with pornographic descriptions of the sex life of a nymphomaniac?The rest of the book was super beautiful and quite moving and stuff, but it's a bit difficult to hold on to that feeling when the genitals are flying around your ears.I actually don't know if I read this book for the first time or if I read it before.It reads like a tit.You are immediately immersed in the story and it is very humorous at times.I do find him very rude and misogynistic.The red ears that many people got from reading it in the past have not come to me.But he writes very beautifully about his love for Olga and I believe she loved only him too. The last chapter was endearingly beautiful.Very sexual book but not annoying.Story was hard to follow at first.Also very nice book.So far I´m not quite sure what to think about this book.It´s a bit more graphic and explicit than what I usually read (with the exception of LKH, possibly), however as this book (and the movie) are quite well-known in The Netherlands I figured I´d give it a go.I´ve been reading bits and pieces of this book for a while now and expect I will for some time yet.The "verdict" will follow once I´m all done with it.Book in which eroticism occupies a heavily exaggerated, and no longer functional, place.Actually 1 star, or maybe we don't at all.As far as I'm concerned, the two stars are for the story, stripped of all senseless eroticism.Because the story is good, but unfortunately it is told in the wrong way.Later books by Wolkers prove that he can indeed write in an acceptable manner.wolkers is in this novel of philip roth hung out like the european chapter.so I felt a very familiar perspective on sexuality and relationships throughout the book.So much so that I had the feeling that Roth was dealing with almost the same subject, in the same frame, as The Dying Animal, which he wrote years later.It has also become an exemplary publishing product with its translation and eye-catching illustration. Note with spoilers: There is not the slightest thing about Turkey in the book.Don't get too hung up on the name.'Turks Delight' by Jan Wolkers is actually a very beautiful love story to me.No sugary romance, the lovemaking is often described as obscene, but behind those revealing passages there is a story that is passionate but also deeply tragic.How touching is Eric's love for Olga who, despite her leaving him, still loves her and respects her to the end.I read this book for my Dutch oral exam and I really expected a horror because of the stories I had heard about it, but that was not so bad!In fact, he was very beautiful.Yes, there is a lot of sex in it (like really a lot) and quite a few peers stumbled over that when I read it, but it was also a very nice story.Remains my absolute number 1 in Dutch literature.Very beautiful, melancholy story about a lost love.Very erotic, but above all incredibly romantic.I keep rereading.Keeps gripping me This is a funny, haunting, vulgar delight.The story of love and loss, personal gravity as it plays out over time and ultimately beyond death stays with you for some time after reading it.Wolkers also gets the evocation of casual sex and seduction just right.I had to reread it for my education.Unlike the first time I read the book, I found the excess of explicit sex in the book disturbing.I did enjoy the dry humour.I give the 4 stars more for the beautiful language than for the story itself.You wonder where Jan Wolkers gets some descriptions from.A book full of raw words that make the corners of your mouth curl spontaneously.Turks Fruit is and remains my favorite book from Dutch literature.There is a beautiful story behind all the dirty practices.I read it in one breath, and was immediately gripped by the story.The end of the magical sixties.Language interspersed with body parts that did not appear in the dictionary of the Christian Netherlands.Liberating sex!A tragic and romantic story.Super.A book you should read at least once in your life!Is it the place where destiny takes a person or the life determined by one's own will?Olga chose her own destiny, but fate was the only one who wrote the ending, with its quirks, of course.It's a short and good read...it's definitely thought-provoking at the end.This was one of the first Dutch novels I read.Back then: red ears.When I reread the book years later, I found out that it is also extraordinarily well written.All major themes are covered in it.In other words: a monument!Beautiful book.I really felt for the main character and it had a very good storyline.Very clever how the relationship and love between the main characters is described.The movie is also recommended, but the book is really nicer (often so hey ;-) ).Too much sex.Sorry, but for me it was overkill.I also didn't find the progression of the story to be smooth throughout the book.I have to admit that I cried at the last chapter.1.5 stars.the ending was sad, the rest of the story not interesting.personally not a big fan of the main character.I had to read this for school definitely not voluntarily.favorite character: not actually 1st read: ?2nd read: April 2013 Wow!Really good second-time read.Heartbreaking story about a man who loses his wife.Trying to get her back.And in which the woman eventually dies. Very nicely written.With a surprise ending."Obscenity" aside this is a wonderful love story and the author manages to convey a fair part of what he feels in the depths of his passion.Wonderful!Rough and hard but at the same time moving and truly beautiful!In my top 5 favorite books.erg erotisch maar goed verhaal A Dutch classic, rereading because I watched the movie again the other day, after thirty years.Believe it or not, Rutger Hauer was sexy once.And this book is beautiful.I don't like it when the main character tells the complete story.Best book ever.Nice Turkish delight reread.It was written in 1969 but still stands firm as a house.Recommended for readers of shades of gray, but beware: this is 1000 shades of dark black.Classic.Must-read.1969 7/10Slightly oversexed book, but entertaining and easier to read than most compulsory literature.Many motifs and such that stand out.First I hated the book, then I started to look it and at the end I thought it a very pretty, but sad, story.Always nice.A book that grows on you What a beautiful book: so romantic, but so sad... A classic about love, life and death that I, oddly enough, hadn't read yet.Hasn't lost any of its storytelling power yet.http://www.depit.nl/magazine/turks-fr... yes what can I say?it was an obligation for my reading list for Dutch, but enjoying it is another story... Deeply impressed by the fantastic way in which Jan Wolkers reads this monument of love.Gosh....This is unbelievable.I was ashamed, I laughed, I was shocked but the reading went so smooth that I certainly enjoyed it.FAVORITE FOREVER I read this book every year!I just cry my eyes out!sexsexsexsex = dutch literary masterpiece Magnificent.Just read and cry.Together with The Golden Egg by Tim Krabbé one of my favorite books.Tried to describe it to someone today, I said it was "raw".Really it's a book that evokes a lot of emotions and it's easily one of the most readworthy books you can come across.Still a ten after reading three times.Coarse, funny, sweet and so raw.At that time all sex passages would have been very recalcitrant but if you read it now it's too much.However, if you read through that, the story is very beautiful and gripping.There are few things I like better than the last few pages of this book.That she wanted it that way.Heartbreaking and raw.Life as it can be.3,5 ⭐️ A bittersweet novel.Forced myself to read this book because of all the fuzz, but was kinda disgusted by it.I read this book in one go....I was sixteen.So many years after its publication, the book feels outdated.The movie was better... Written very explicitly.The author has incorporated the sexual passages into the story so well that it does not become too vulgar.Topboek  And another book whose arrival on my shelf was preceded by its reputation.I knew this to be a short smutty but chatty fun novelette with a bit of a cult around it, and I picked it up to practice my Dutch and not think too much about it.This fulfilled its didactic purpose, by which I mean the polishing of language skills and nothing more (the vocabulary I learned, though!...), because, quite frankly, this little novel is a bit dated in its show-offy but fine, I admit, ultimately cute descriptions of raunchy sex.The trouble is that I strongly suspect that I've underestimated this book, as I was only jolted into attentive reading mode about two thirds into it, when the protagonist/narrator breaks character and does something genre-transforming to this story, and his way of going on about it raised a few red flags.So, what we have here is the biography of a beautiful quirky dead manic pixie girl told by her first husband who is posing as the love of her life, and my problem is that I can't decide to what extent is the author aware of and in dialog with the problematique accompanying this format of storytelling.For one thing, he's a sculptor by trade, and she happily acts as his model.Add to this the numerous mentions of his civilizing influence on her, and the clothes he bought her, and the self-image defining photographs he took of her, and it all looks like a deliberate effort to establish a Pygmalion and Galatea dynamic.Yet for the longest time this beatific condescension is placed in opposition to the heroine's submission to the wishes of her controlling mother, literally referred to as the evil witch by the narrator.In the book's climactic scene (yeah, literally climactic), he is struggling to wrest a sigh of enjoyment from his beloved over the intrusive protestations of her apoplectic mother, and he's not modest about his triumph, nor is he overburdened by scruples about what this did to her -- his beloved's -- own agency.I trust I'm not spoiling anything by saying that there comes a moment when she almost completely descends into infancy, her means of self-expression severely impaired (this plot twist is announced on the blurb of the back cover of my edition).The narrator is the only one around to piece together some kind of identity of hers, and he goes ahead and buys her a wig that makes her look like an approximation of the person she used to be while they were an item.And this after we are told that she used to change hairstyles as a way to distance herself from the men she had been with, and after we witness her discomfort at seeing the photos the narrator had taken of her with her long red hair.The book ends with the narrator remarking on her desire to have and identify with that wig, and their former life together being posited as a paradise lost, specifically for her.Now, my question is: do we have ourselves a myopic, unreliable narrator here, or are the alternative interpretations only inadvertently excluded?Turkish Delight is an experience as much as it is a story.It shocks you with its vulgar and filthy language but humbles you with its raw presentation.I think I should read it sometime.Laughed a lot.what language.and there was even a spittle bug in it.
