INITIAL THOUGHTSExcuse I sob corner heart aches Lily Kath content.I ’ incredibly impressed Zeller ’ narration : languages , voices , accents . 4.5 Stars CWs : Some exploration racism , deportation , xenophobia , homophobia , underage drinking , graphic sex , mention miscarriage , outdated racial social epithets ( relevant time period ) , exploration familial estrangement disownmentI 'll : queer historical YA dreams . It manages capture impeccable place time celebrating reclaiming queer histories . That 100 % jam , I Malinda Lo absolutely nailed it.The story 's intersectional lens invaluable , especially considering time period set . The 1950 's California fraught time politically , racially , socially . This time period considered unusual ( `` unnecessary '' ) women continue education . It time interracial marriage legal , `` same-sex '' marriage partnerships . It Red-Scare paranoia reaching fever pitch , Chinese immigrants Chinese-American citizens deported discriminated premise `` Communist loyalists . '' As young , queer Chinese-American girl , Lily contend issues figure navigate world 's her.What inevitably stick book easily 've trauma , repression , internalization homophobia—but instead , overarching feeling stems story warmth , belonging , self-discovery . Make mistake , historically accurate narrative addresses all-too-real obstacles hardships queer color , especially , deal time period , 's Lily finding ways work obstacles fighting few-and-far-between moments free express . It 's hardships existed , , hardship , it—there vibrant counterculture queer existing thriving loving other.The story brilliantly captures feeling discovering belong , discovering safe spaces , surrender allowing . Those moments Lily entering Telegraph Club instinctually recognizing dynamic , code-switching counterculture intoxicating , 's finally understand feelings 's taught deny erase . More importantly , Telegraph Club place represents queer futurity queer normalcy . For young Lily queer adults living lives , forging relationships , holding everyday jobs , celebrating queerness loud life-changing . It confidence stay , easier live `` normal '' life 's laid her.To , I effective themes story exploration performance . As scientifically-minded Chinese-American young woman living Red-Scare , Lily constantly confronted cultivate `` image . '' She `` Chinese girl '' family happy , present `` American '' order distance `` Communist sympathizers '' community , interests appropriate `` suits young lady . '' And , course , hide queerness , deemed scandalous , illegal , shameful . So constantly perform role `` perfect Chinese daughter , '' encouraged pursue emulate whiteness , suppressing authentic desires feelings.Being `` pass '' situation requires performance , , performance means survival . As story progresses , I Lily beginning understand tenuous relationship `` performing '' `` masking , '' 's learning 's safe drop performance . We aspect literal performance Telegraph Club , headlining male impersonator `` Tommy Andrews . '' This show `` perform '' order hide conceal , perform lean authenticity differences , especially instinct self-preserve tells pull back . Lily learns great deal living loud , important parts n't simply disappear occupies different spaces.Overall , beautiful story self-discovery , queer desire , carving space world anticipate . It 's tender love , queer community , found family , staying times . This , , historical fiction books I 've read , I I 'll recommending wide years ! TO . JEST . LITERATURA . Po zastanowieniu daję jej 3.5/5 4 gwiazdki w skali , nie jest zła książka . Jest jednak niesamowicie powolna dla mnie niektóre momenty zbyt przegadane . Uważam , że 400 stron można spokojnie zmieścić w 200 . Ciężko się niej przez wracało . Doceniam ją tło historyczne , retro klimat Lily , która była prostu precious . The amount positive , affirming , LGBT representation young adult fiction skyrocketed I teenager . For reason , time I read book Last Night Telegraph Club , I overwhelmed glad I book exists . Not I read enjoy , current future LGBT teenagers reflected books read I . Any book communicates message “ LGBT exist , LGBT existed , ’ normal ’ worthy love success ” book I ’ concerned.Last Night Telegraph Club ’ lesbian rep , I stress validated I felt reading Lily ’ experiences . Seeing reflected work fiction music art . In fact , complaint book – reason I rated stars instead – I wanted exploration Lily ’ journey . I read hundred pages , parts felt rushed , particularly end.Though I understand Lily ’ experience Chinese American daughter first- second-generation immigrants , I well-written enlightening . Particularly eye-opening Lily pulled different directions identities Chinese American lesbian . In Chinatown , felt express authentically – I relate , grown religious community accepting LGBT – Chinatown ( white ) lesbians , felt outsider Chinese.This character-driven book , classic coming-of-age story I resonate adult readers . I ’ read Malinda Lo ’ previous books I ’ YA fantasy science fiction I , historical fiction ( contemporary fiction ) I definitely check . Clearly research , managed bring characters book – particularly Lily – life speaks writing abilities.As final note slight spoiler , LGBT readers burned LGBT historical fiction , I assure Lily girlfriend Kath , institution , “ turn straight , ” fact ending , open-ended , optimistic happy . 1.5 ⭐Even moments absolutely precious , I found book boring honest . . . 😶All side characters nerves ( Shirley especially ) times blend kind person . All queers , chinese family . Same personality , speaking dressing , background . Also I n't understand put flashback chapters middle story . It completely threw plot story interesting , Malinda Lo decided put random chapter Lily 's family middle reason kinda person year ... Overall , I wish plot developed stoic interesting instead random chapters Lily 's boring day day life things Kath 's perspective . Even I appreciate rep research author make book , I n't enjoy time reading . 😭 Content warnings : gay club raid , homophobia , racism , exotification , n-word descriptor I loved book much.It tentative gentle simultaneously rough read times heartbreaking . It tackles Asian queer woman ( lesbian ) 50s , tackles issues Chinese community faces back , head . So 's pretty rounded story . I loved Lili Kath 's relationship explored , Lili 's relationship queerness . How oblivious , , long faced bubbling . How feelings girl , underground gay club made FEEL things persuade . But faced embraced , back shove back . Nor . “ Haven ’ wondered keeping attached ground ? ” Last Night Telegraph Club wonderful , heartfelt historical deals intersectionality , discovering ’ identity , love.I love slow burn romance , I forget I love slow burn aspects storytelling friendships discovery . Lo includes layers book , ’ impossible feel . The intersection race , gender , sexuality crucial story historical backdrop story set . Being Bay Area , I felt home atmosphere book Lily faced overcame hardships made character easily likable . I stuck book heart put . The family dynamics felt real , devastating times , I begin explain incredible impact tension Lily family mood book . What Lily felt , I felt , reader , important . I ’ relate character , I understand actions . This easy Lily.The relationship Lily Kath highlight book . Their development perfectly paced connection chemistry entered realm necessity . It ’ wanted , needed fully experience life offer . The political racial elements book strengthened idea enforced importance intersectionality.With political undertones racial themes book , plot twist provided adequate tension characters strain motivations actions . While story difficult digest times content , felt added vibrant atmosphere book.This book radiates queer positivity deserve read . This book similar `` Tipping Velvet , '' debut Sarah Waters . But instead set Victorian England , `` Last Night Telegraph Club '' set San Francisco 1950s.Both novels focus forbidden love world lesbian bars male impersonators . `` Last Night Telegraph Club '' deals additional problem racism . The character , Lily Hu , lives conservative Chinatown Chinese descent.The part detailed portrait time period postwar San Francisco , carefully researched faithfully executed . Malinda Lo 's attention detail excellent regard . The problem plot involving Telegraph Club , smoke-filled bar draw entertainment male impersonation , i.e. , female actress dresses performs male singer/entertainer . I honestly n't understand obsession ( literally obsession ) male impersonation `` Tipping Velvet '' `` Last Night Telegraph Club . '' Gender-swapped theater back Shakespeare 's time . Why fascinating ? The obsession male impersonation over-the-top all-consuming characters books . Anyway , continue point : 's believable character , Lily , back The Telegraph Club , racist . The Telegraph Club smoking , drinking , partying , lowbrow entertainment . Yet Lily finding drawn back place treat badly , launching racial slurs . It believable . But apparently Lily coming back Telegraph Club author advance overarching plot line , leading tragic finale . Overall book , especially well-researched setting . But parts plot forced unoriginal light `` Tipping Velvet . '' beautiful , lovingly written story chinese-american lesbian teenager discovering sexuality finding love 50s . author manages draw different threads history - lives chinese-american citizens wake world II , queer community 1950s san francisco - wraps intimate story young girl find fraught , marginalized communities dangerous . felt lily kath 's innocent , burgeoning relationship love , despite , managed carve place hope future .

New favourite book jak przerzuciłam ostatnią stronę okazało się , że już koniec miałam takie : jak koniec halo chcę więcej wydarzeń rok później… . książka bardzo się spodobała bardzo chętnie wróciłabym niej ponownie🫡 3,5⭐️7/10Podobało się ! Chociaż pewno nie jest książka dla osób , które nudzą się przy historiach bez akcji - nie znajdziecie . Wszystko idzie powolutku bardziej skupiamy się tych wszystkich emocjach towarzyszących bohaterkom , co jest ogromnym plusem książki , momenty gdzie Lily odkrywa czego naprawdę potrzebuje & gt ; & gt ; Jest romans wlw , nie jakoś dużo , więc ’ happy takie książki powstają jest coraz więcej.W jak mówiłam skupiamy się głównie emocjach , odkrywaniu tożsamości swoich własnych uczuć przez Lily . Klimat książki jest świetny , dziewczyna boi przyznać nawet przed samą sobą co czuję powoduje chociażby czas miejsce w którym żyje , San Francisco lata 50 gdzie obraz miasta jest przedstawiony jako nieakceptujący „ odmienności ” jak zaznaczają . Ogromne plusy właśnie klimat , przedstawienie miejsca w jakim żyją bohaterki , przedstawione problemy odbieranie przez społeczność , politykę itp . Co się „ powinno ” , nie chce . Chciałabym jednak jakoś bardziej rozbudowane zakończenie , brakowało jak takiej truskawki torcie , aleee jest bardzo oki ! This book filled hole heart .

Dass Lily “ Telegraph Club ” , queeren Nachtclub , aufsucht , Beispiel Rassismus Exotisierung entgegenkommt ; , Erwartungen Druck Tochter China eingewanderten Familie steht .

The story set 1950s San Francisco Chinatown . This time period women stopped education high school favor traditional nuclear family . Interracial marriage illegal . Same-sex relationships viewed perverse , sexual deviant behavior . And addition Red-Scare paranoia deeply rooted US soil . And author beautifully weaves telling Lily Hu 's story . The Telegraph Club literally sanctuary queer folks shed guises wear order fit conform society . From beginning , Lily 's sexual identity clear , suppression due `` Chinese girl '' family community avoid target gossip school heart wrenching .

There lot work , , lets talk . So I cis , 20-something year Asian , meaning perspective book gay/lesbian . I rating based perspective , 're different perspective , enjoy book 's completely 100 % alright . Anyways , related , text title Emily Pan states `` This book loved - word . '' Yea straight lie . This book specifically lesbian relationship 1950 's , 's told primarily lens , made difficult relate personal level universal feeling experience displayed book . Even confides 'love ' 's specifically 'teenage ' love , bumps whistles entail . Which fine , fine niche , book made , yea , books n't claiming title blurb . But I digress . So confides love story , I feel book falls short , due fact Lily Kath n't character . Kath , I 3 things . She 's teenager , 's lesbian , pilot . That 's . She n't . She 's honestly forgettable , problem 's love interest . Also I find Lily engaging , problematic central conflict story , motivating reader hearing Lily 's thoughts processes . But I feel Lily n't unique ? ? Yeah flowery prose interesting metaphors , ultimately insights n't interesting . Like things ? People messed 1950s ? Homosexual relationships complicated 50 's ? Yea , I sort knew . And boy present roadblock times reading book . For reference , I fast reader , I put 900 page book week , 350 ( kindle ) page book forever amazing fast I bored reading book . And , Lily Kath 'okay ' characters book , literally sucks . Like terrible things terrible behaviors , probably point book , n't keeping engaged , raising blood sugar . Oh annoyed , Lily suppose 17 mental image defaulting 12 year . She behaves pre-teen , omg , freaking talk woman . Like early scenario avoids guy asked dance . Bro 'sorry I 'm interested . ' I feel unreasonable , especially choice ultimately n't ? ! ? ! It 's insane . Like I 17 year n't bastions decisions , reasoning problem solving skills . Come Lo . Anyways I , needless , I book , sort sucks I acknowledge point view talking , I acknowledge words book , story n't story technical , I recommend fall group story reach . How precious , miraculous . A ago , I sort gave Malinda Lo , kind deciding style n't . I 'm glad I reconsidered & nbsp ; gave book chance , I much.I n't read lot fiction takes place American 1950s , smack dab middle red scare . And I 've read teenage , lesbian , Chinese-American perspective . This incredibly & nbsp ; well-researched , character-focused , lot emphasis history character 's internal musings , self-discovery personal growth . Coming out/self discovery historical milieu amazing read , perfect . It intense , made , Lily unsure girls existed , euphoria finding n't . It n't found family vibe , definitely community Telegraph Club , joy Lily found Kath women . The romance wonderful , n't centre-stage . It Lily coming terms . It finding water drought . She ’ drink , thirst made ashamed , shame made angry . The historical titbits fascinating , I wanted . I subplot communist group consequential ; side characters n't stake story I hoped/thought . I scenes talking space/Lily Kath 's aspirations . The ending definitely n't fleshed I 've hoped , things happened screen I wanted see.Thankfully , I nit-picks . My grouse Lo 's head-hopping books , ( biggest writing peeve ) book blessedly told solely Lily 's person POV . There flashbacks told perspectives side characters , , added atmosphere context ( , I n't enjoyed book ) . Listened audiobook read Emily Woo Zeller , fantastic helped enjoyment . I adore timbre voice , 's talented voices accents . Check Hsinju 's review thoughts . I 'm pleasantly surprised . I probably n't read Lo 's backlist , I 'll eye future work ! 5 stars ! * `` ... ’ parents expected . '' Last Night Telegraph Club easy read .

Ho voglia incredibile bestemmiare libro called diecimila modi diversiNiente , davvero cosa dire riuscirei esprimere parole ciò libro fatto provareIl romanzo inizia maniera tranquilla , lentamente dà esattamente l'idea trovarsi dento ricordo , sembra quasi ovattato , attraverso filtro . Ma passo dopo passo narrazione diventa attiva molti casi veloce ansiosa , trasmette bene senso segretezza paura protagonista , Lily , prese scoperta sé conoscenza , `` consapevolezza definitiva '' sessualità.Il primo approccio Kath , uscita nascosto andare Telegraph Club , libri `` scandalosi '' mostrano personaggi `` deviati '' `` sbagliati '' lasciano senso disagio inadeguatezza , pagine riviste strappate preservate foto donne impersonano uomini , paura qualcuno possa scoprire soprattutto , segreto profondo l'unica realtà verità dovrai tenere nascosta sempreIl misto avvenimenti storici drammatici , rischio deportazione cittadini americani cinesi incursioni scovare comunisti persone omosessuali , ogni mossa rischia essere vista notata occhi sbagliati ogni conoscenza potrebbe costarti . Ma stesso tempo storia riesce offrire momenti leggerezza spensieratezza , scoperta primo amore brivido fare qualcosa resto mondo pensa sbagliata invece giusta definisce , dà luogo , gente , appartenere nonostante tuttoIl contesto storico favorito dall'inserimento , fine ogni parte romanzo , capitoli parte familiari Lily ( , madre , padre zia , ruoli importanti finale storia ) È doveroso sottolineare presenza eventuali trigger warning momenti omofobia soprattutto lesbofobia , razzismo amicizie tossiche . Cose , seppur dolorose , reso libro , nonostante tratti romanzo storico , tremendamente , sfortunatamente , molto attualeDevo ammettere scena coming ( forzato ) l'amica successivamente madre , distrutta emotivamente fisicamente risvolti hit close homeNonostante , , finale lascia piccolo , immenso spiraglio speranza nuove possibilità , spero vivamente Lily colto , sicura , dopo tutta l'evoluzione compiuta personaggio libro , modo forza fare senza voltarsi indietro TW : omofobia , razzismoMi sento parecchio delusa lettura.Era uscite attendevo maggiormente 2022 , invece purtroppo aspettative state soddisfatte . Forse aspettavo storia diversa , dico già NON assolutamente Evelyn Hugo 2.0.Quel libro inarrivabile irripetibile.La notte scorsa telegraph club qualcosa già visto fatto . La premessa interessante : Lily , ragazza cinese 17 anni , vive San Francisco anni '50 , quindi contesto chiuso bigotto , realizza essere lesbica . Ora , comprendo probabilmente l'obiettivo Malinda Lo trasmettere ingiustizie discriminazioni vissute queer asian community all'epoca . Però , arrivati 2022 davvero ancora necessario narrare storyline LGBTQ+ dolore dramma ? Non parte né comunità asiatica , né saffica , state parecchie scene triggerata lettura , quindi oso immaginare persone rappresentate . Penso servano storie queer joy , La notte scorsa telegraph club . Inoltre , ship coinvolta apprezzato ' stata gestita situazione . Ma altro problema riguarda caratterizzazione personaggi , inesistente . Lily protagoniste scialbe letto , percorso evoluzione , anzi sempre balia ciò altri scelgono . Kath , l'interesse amoroso , figura mono dimensionale vediamo solo tramite occhi Lily oltre informazioni base , sappiamo nulla . Paradossalmente , spesso capitoli interi genitori , zii , amiche , compagnia cantante otteniamo informazioni personaggi principali . Lo stile scrittura memorabile , persona bianca caucasica sento aver arricchito bagaglio culturale dopo lettura dispiace . Mi sembrata un'occasione sprecata , poiché imparato nulla comunità cinese rispetto ciò già , anzi romanzo secondo contribuisce alimentarne stereotipi . Non stata scelta voluta Malinda Lo , visti anni ambientate vicende . Resta fatto oltre provare rabbia micro/macro aggressioni Lily subisce , riuscita empatizzare succede . Secondo resta sempre problema scrittura , * brav * autor * permette immedesimarti situazioni vivrai . Ad esempio , trilogia La Quinta Stagione N.K . Jemisin percepisci discriminazioni , abusi l'odio personaggi neri subiscono , vivendo , persona bianca caucasica privilegiata . Qui semplicemente manca quell'empatia fondo . L'alone mistero intorno Telegraph Club interessante locale stesso , aspettavo qualcosa differente . Il finale soddisfacente 3/4 storia.Diciamo apprezzato prime 150 pagine scorrevolezza libro.Per resto sento consigliarlo . Marvelous . “ Haven ’ wondered keeping attached ground ? ” Ay libro . Belleza libro , belleza historia personajes . Siento libro esperaba , realmente sabía iba pasar acordaba sinopsis ( acabo releer ahora terminado libro ) . Pero historia enganchó demasiado , enamoré página , pinta libros favoritos año.Imagínate : 1950 , Estados Unidos , adolescente hija inmigrantes chinos descubriendo sexualidad , entiende sentimientos diferentes creía . Pero amenaza guerra , Estados Unidos acusando inmigrantes chinos comunistas , homosexualidad aceptada casi ningún lado . La tensión miedo sentía rato pasaba Lily familia indescriptible , hace sentir aún día hoy existan personas vivir miedo amar quieren amar . La historia , emociones desea transmitir autora , llega corazón través palabras escenas , siento manera libro escrito logra cometido transmite mensaje . Los personajes robado corazón . Siento hecho autora lograra incorporar escenas puntos vistas padres tía Lily ayudó muchísimo conocer solo historia personajes , sino aprender historia comunidad china Estados Unidos años , fondo vida Lily cómo sido ambiente crecido espera partir vivido padres . Y hace entiendas aún Lily descubrimiento , cómo conoce Kath , alguien completamente sorprendente diferente conoce . Ambas personalidad hizo conectar , robaron corazón . Incluso personajes desesperantes ( Shirley ) , hicieron hechos , dieron mucha lástima , vez , siento entendía . Es situación complicada , analizas distintos puntos vista , llegas entender vivir ambiente así , libertad palabra significado.En fin , voy ramas . El romance precioso , lento lindo , precioso juro motivaba seguir leyendo . Me hizo sentir triste , asustada emocionada emociones transmitían protagonistas . Estoy feliz haber encontrado libro .

So Kathleen , girl studying Advanced Math school , offers , ’ resist temptation show . I wanted hard fall love book . It shines light important topics ’ discussed , ’ told unique narrator , takes place 1950s , time history glossed YA books . It ’ clear lot time effort writing book , I appreciate author daring , unlike hackneyed tropes ’ YA novels . The blurb states “ ambitious ” indeed , astounding achievement successfully tackle topics ( precarious situation Chinese immigrants 1950s , life Chinese American , homophobia , rocket girls , lesbian culture 1950s , Communism ) . However , reason I ’ giving book higher rating things , ’ explored wrapped satisfactory , ultimately left feeling book disjointed unfocused . To start , shift focus Lily ’ storyline 1950s family previous years . These past perspectives ’ add depth characters play important role line . Instead enriching book , interrupt draw attention away real protagonists . I understand author wanted give background , I ’ flashbacks it.Even present , elements mentioned times left hanging air , leaving questions unanswered . It 's book open ending , 's simply conflicts arise left completely unresolved . While narrators chapters , real stars book Lily ( Kathleen -the love interest- Tommy Andrews -the male impersonator accounts The Telegraph Club ’ success ’ reason Lily Kathleen ) ’ attention deserve . It ’ frustrating disappointing interesting characters underdeveloped . I wish flashbacks glimpse Kathleen ’ past instead ( especially friendship Janet , time Telegraph Club time asked Lily geometry exam ) .Had execution different , I recommended .

I ’ big historical fiction I glad I read . The writing characters amazing . Malinda Lo ! Thank writing Lesbian Tragedy epilogue ! Swoon This practically perfect . Ta książka bardzo bolała , była realistyczna . Zaimponowało przede wszystkim , jak sprawnie autorka przeplatała wydarzenia fikcyjne rzeczywistymi faktami historycznymi . Pokochałam również , jak dobitnie ukazano obraz okrutnych frustrujących stereotypów , powszechnych w latach '50 . Wierzcie lub nie , czytając przykładowych absurdalnych zachowaniach , byłam bardzo zirytowana , jakby ktoś mówił w twarz . Z rzeczy przyjemniejszych , wątek romantyczny poprowadzony został w przepiękny sposób . Motylki w brzuchu są dla mnie wyznacznikiem `` jak dobra jest dana lektura '' . Ta zdecydowanie spełnia ten wymóg . Bohaterki przez cały czas odnajdywały siebie , usilnie próbując dowiedzieć się , co naprawdę czują jakie są naprawdę . Dzięki w epilogu były ogromnie silnymi kobietami , co pokazało niezwykłą wartość . Książka przypomina trochę `` Arystotelesa Dantego '' . Akcja dzieje się powoli , pokazane są ważne problemy tematy historyczne , postacie przechodzą pewnego rodzaju glow wewnętrzny . Ari Dante ulubiona książka , więc Klub Telegraph raczej również dostąpi tego miana . ✩ 4 stars~tw : homophobia , racism , racial slurs , xenophobia , miscarriage , underage drinking , family estrangement~ “ Haven ’ wondered attached ground. ” • “ Perhaps day ’ made feel .

However , picnic mentioned forgotten characters pushed side . Even seemingly important discovery I talked quickly covered argument boom .

Este daquelas histórias gostaria preservar pouco , sofri sorri escolhas Lily . Cały czas bałam się spodziewała się momentu , kiedy homofobia lat 50. spadnie główne bohaterki całą mocą przemocy w postaci co najmniej obrażeń fizycznych lub lobotomii . Takiego momentu nie było - owszem , homofobia jest wszechobecna , dławiąca , atakuje strony aparatów państwowych instytucji rodzinnych , zostaje miejsce oddech , czy w Klubie Telegraph , gdzie można być sobą czy w relacji głównych bohaterek , która rozkwita nieprzychylnym gruncie . Moment konfrontacji jest zadziwiająco współczesny , chociaż przesiąknięty stereotypami tego okresu - rolami płciowymi , czy przekonaniem , że lesbijki żyją umierają samotnie jako wyrzutki społeczne - stereotypy wciąż żyją argumenty powtarzają się niezmiennie pół wieku , nieważne , jak bardzo są głupie nieprawdziwe ( homofobia jest głupia fantazmatyczna ) . Z jednej strony doceniam , że dziewczyny mają szansę szczęśliwe życie , takie historie też się pojawiają w queerowej historii zawsze , dobrze przypomnieć , że nawet w cna homofobicznym społeczeństwie można żyć - trudem pomimo , można - być szczęśliwym . Przemocowe tragiczne queerowe historie lat 50. łatwo znaleźć , wpisują się w popkulturowe schematy . Z drugiej strony , lęki , które dopadały mnie w trakcie lektury nie wzięły się znikąd - części winne wspomniane schematy , części struktura powieści , gdzie ten strach wisi główną bohaterką jest uzasadniony . W efekcie powieść nie punktu kulminacyjnego , emocjonalne napięcie nie zostaje rozładowane tylko się rozmywa . Pojawia się gdzieś planie , w formie rajdu policyjnego klub . Może gdybyśmy czytali punktu widzenia Katie byłoby inaczej . Powieść jest świetnie napisana , klimatyczna , pełna szczegółów , które sprawiają , że dana epoka miejsce stają się realne - odniesień popkultury ( utopijne science fiction ! ) , aktualnych wydarzeń , trendów społecznych ( strach przed komunistami , państwowy opresji , rasizm epoki ) . Lily jest pełnowymiarową postacią , podobnie jak wszyscy , którzy ją otaczają . Powieść żyje wciąga czytelnika w swój świat . Zdecydowanie warta polecenia powieść queerowym dorastaniu . Things great queer 70yrs ago , US . And things , I feel 're losing queer history . And I feel historical stories queer color rarely told . This story queer Chinese American girl coming age 1950s US . And reason , I give book 3 stars , 's important stories these.Unfortunately , content important , book . There dozens plot threads - Lily ’ adventures The Telegraph Club , budding relationship Kath , fracturing relationship friend Shirley , Shirley 's involvement young associated Communist party , law enforcement threatening Lily ’ father 's citizenship , more.More , book random POV switches alternating timelines .

Als Schulprojekt Kath kennenlernt , klar , fühlt , erwartet . Gemeinsam besuchen nachts heimlich Telegraph Club , geheime Bar Lesben , Herrenimitatorin auftritt.Die Geschichte Buches ruhig herrlich unaufgeregt erzählt . In meisten Szenen folgen einfach Lilys alltäglichem Leben . Was ersten Blick langweilig wirken , zeigt tatsächlich viele Aspekte Lebens 50er Jahren junge , mehrfach marginalisierte Person . Lily Familie müssen Menge Rassismus ergehen lassen . Bei Dingen geschockt , damals normal galt , Dingen traurig , wundern , heute geschehen . Gleichzeitig erlebt Lily , Frau erwartet Gesellschaft Abweichungen davon reagiert.Gerade Perspektive mehrfachen Marginalisierung fand Buch gut ausgearbeitet , Lily Probleme , Platz finden , vollständig zugehörig fühlen darf . Es gibt Zusammenhang gute Diskussionen Rassismus Queerfeindlichkeit , scheinen immer getrennt voneinander abzulaufen – Buch zeigt jedoch , Trennung Lebenswirklichkeit Lily vorbeiläuft.In Zusammenhang gefiel Nachwort Autorin , Recherchearbeit näher erläutert . Dies gibt ganzen Text stärkere Wirkung . Auch Übersetzerin kurze Anmerkung geschrieben , historisch korrekte Sprache angepasst , deutlich negativer behafteten deutschen Worte vermeiden , andererseits neueren Worten greifen , Charaktere Zeit verwendet hätten.Fazit : Mich konnte Geschichte rund Lily Kath absolut überzeugen . Schon genommen schöne Coming Age Story , Verbindung historischen Komponente Tatsache , gezeigten Diskriminierung heute relevant , empfinde Buch wichtig . Ich möchte daher unbedingt weiterempfehlen ! A story young Chinese American navigating gay 1950 's SF , , possibly imagine , thousand steps harder teenager . Lily 16 Kath , clicked immediately . She knew immediately different , .

Bars continue space , Telegraph Club straights clutching pearls scandalous male impersonators lesbian behaviour ( , leave ) . Lily experiences added barrier racism , clubgoers make comments 'orientalism ' infantalises her.I found writing compelling , unfortunately , I round editing . There lots threads seemingly dropped ( fears deported , accusations communism , parents ' flashback story awkwardly dropped ) , I found ending rushed unsatisfying . I wanted relationship long distance ? How Lily feel deal moving away ? Did touch older queer friends ? ? But alas literally chapter , dusted deal.Did n't I wished I .

Last Night Telegraph Club young adult takes place 1950s China Town , Sanfransico . It coming age young Chinese girl coming terms queer identity world brimming panic homophobia . Within time , bar called The Telegraph club serves safe place queer questioning , Lily finds refuge here.This simply beautiful .

I unique experience identify , makes book important.Malinda Lo 's writing extremely approachable easy follow . I 'm definitely struggles remember characters , I issue book . Malinda Lo beautifully painted characters flawed , beautiful , extremely memorable . I fell love I characters feel real . Furthermore , Malinda Lo beautifully outlines authentic lesbian experience touching struggles young Chinese woman combat accept identity justify . The reason 4.5/5 stars blatant plot holes topics brought discussed . The reader led believe topics introduce kind conflict back story . This hinder experience reading book . Malinda Lo makes , I ignore review.I 100 % recommend book . In fact , read . Thanks . Oh , book ! It centers mid-century Chinatown San Francisco , 17-year-old Lily Hu discover change entire course life . I watched , growing excitement recognition , Lily slowly starts piece puzzle queerness . That coming-out happened early 1990s repeated lot patterns comforts appalls . In Lily 's terror desires , reluctances hesitations , insane mood shifts , I absolutely . I wish intervening forty years , things changed more.But Lily 's deck stacked lot ways . 1 . She 's woman . 2 . She 's Chinese-American ( book , Caucasian characters call `` Oriental , '' common back necessarily considered insult , I Lily bristles othering term , ) , 3 . She 's living 1950s , things suspect . I author Malinda Lo n't spend long male gaze T R A G E D Y homosexuality . I find books movies depict queer different , SADNESS LONGING PUNISHMENT . Even progressive stuff 70s lonely dying , 80s 90s AIDS finale lives , aughts feints cohesive stories fell shadows heterosexual counterparts ( murder torture ) . It long stunned progressive depictions gay I found 1980s Stephen King 's It , edges stereotype ends brutal murder.What I 've long wanted book gave historical context queer existence queer relationship recognized dangers day necessarily giving . Sometimes Lily 's reluctance nervousness frustrated , course I understood . How strange young discovering I , repulsed afraid I ? How infinitely strange Lily Hu , girl starts fall love .

I loved book . Hm . Ich weiss recht , Buch sagen soll.Vor Angesicht riesigen Hypes unglaublich guten Bewertungen.Ich verstehe , wieso viele Buch gut finden . Die Hauptfigur chinesisch-amerikanisches Mädchen , Setting San Francisco 50er , geht Findung Sexualität ... Quasi perfektes Rezept Bestseller.Für überhaupt funktioniert.Vielleicht liegt mangelnden Ähnlichkeiten Lily ( Lily : Amerikanerin chinesischen Wurzeln , 17 , 50er-Jahre , Nachtclubs , Luca : Schweizerin , 26 , 2020er-Jahre , 20 Uhr Haus grumpy ) .Vielleicht Flashbacks , Lily 's Eltern Tante führen . Die Immersion Mal gestört , irgendwann Abschnitte vollständig übersprungen.Vielleicht liegt daran , mehrere Sachen Anfang Teil stark `` Achtung , wichtig ! '' deklariert wurden , Endeffekt mässig Einfluss.Jedenfalls Telegraph Club Fall . Ich mochte Lily 's Charakterentwicklung gerne , , sorry Ausdrucksweise , rückgratslosen Mitläuferin Mädchen , Eltern auflehnt . Aber Einzige , wirklich Geschichte mochte . Das Buch jüngeren Personen trotzdem empfehlen , einfach neuen Blickwinkel queeren Community 50er Jahre . Also Buch gilt : Luca TikTok-Hype reingefallen . Obwohl 's wirklich besser wissen .

If liking DNF books , I 've long time ago . I feel promised synopsis delivered . If audiobook , time read . The story dragged , , time I reached halfway point , I read . I n't character n't love interested form opinion . Not mention threats made book important ended leading . I reading . 4.5 Last Night Telegraph Club decent YA , albeit boring long . The story centers character A , ( forgettable characters surface level personalities ... I literally characters book ) Chinese teenage girl living China Town immigrant parents brothers . Watching peers transform coupled pairs boy crazy mares ( rhymed ) , realizes harbors lesbian predilection . Her friend heteronormative exclusive baddie dreams Miss Chinatown . Their relationship relies surface level interactions childhood nostalgia ... spoiler needed , probably guess storyline ends . Anyways , watch finds love character B , cutie school breaks gendered barriers liking airplanes short hair . Soon , begin sneaking night visit local lesbian bar , The Telegraph Club . BUT , twist fate , 1950 's gay means persecuted society , government , police , . Furthermore , character A Chinese Americans racist hell , naturally , suspect Asians harboring communist ties . This situation threatens Character A Character B 's love , character A 's family . It 's , coming-out scenes , 's drama , police raids lesbian bar , 's surprise ( surprising 're familiar queer history ) ending . I , sounds , unfortunately , YA nature story left gaping holes storyline , stones unturned , situations described significantly interesting detail , general disappointment book existed written adults . The positives exist . This YA existed back high school days potentially expedited fellow queers ' coming experiences ... I , n't realize option back , negative propaganda-based representation . Lo refuses ignore rampant racism existed lesbian scene , older white lesbians calling character A `` china doll '' `` oriental . '' This refreshing , older white queer stories n't acknowledge racism . So , representation , YA ( deal boring writing , dialogue , plot holes . ) I understand hype premise believe book stands merit . Side note gender book : I appreciate constricting gendered boundaries lesbian couple . There butch femme . The representation couples popular media exist strict gender binary , queer couples ( subvert gender mores enacting opposite gender sex , I.e . butch/studs/dykes ) straight couples ( man/woman pairing ) , leads popular imagination romantic pairings Yin Yang-esque relationships . Each contain components masculinity femininity considered . This leads confusing situation queer folks ( straight couples feminine presenting masculine presenting women ) experience representation media . This lack representation leads societal response couples entails confusion , questioning , overarching desire place couples binary . “ Are top bottom ? ” “ Are woman ? ” This fault butch/femme individuals , existing representations gender appreciate feel comfortable . The man/woman straight couples . The problem , , lays unspoken demands conformity arise representation couples binary . Some examples include , course , Last Night Telegraph Club reality tv show Tampa Baes . Both popular queer media solely represent butch/femme dynamics . One hard pressed find queer show book ’ overly represent gendered dynamic , ’ probably easier recent pushback binary . This representation creates gender dysphoria trapped enacting role gender , ’ wish abide strict guidelines existence , love gender non-conforming , gender non-conforming themself . The cure greater diversity representation coupled pairs ( queer straight ) greater appreciation couples , abolition social structure gender . bloody stars ! ! loved book ! felt single emotion reading book . reading 'the husbands evelyn hugo ' desperate historical fiction book sapphic romance guess ? book totally served .

Examples include : societal expectations , political climate , concept privilege & amp ; marginalisation . In particular , I found notion societal expectations book - highlights tension Lily 's heart belongs vs family expects ( based cultural upbringing ) . + Historical + cultural context : I applaud Malinda Lo 's ability craft historically accurate fiction calibre . I background book carefully researched relevant historical events cultural aspects community . Through accurate portrayal , feels San Francisco 1950s brought back life I reading book ! What : - Writing style : I 'm fairly neutral writing style . I I easily engage timeline story . I strikes balance accurate historical details info-dumping . But time , I writing style n't give sufficient leverage penetrate fully Lily 's emotional headspace . I Lily lot emotionally course e.g . ambitions journey coming age , gave great opportunities character development , I personally n't invested romance.- Pacing : My biggest issue pacing . I personally found pacing bit uneven book . While I n't mind flashback scenes backstories pretty job exploring central themes , I found final 1/3 bit rushed & amp ; jumped bit . Nevertheless , I appreciated romance slow-burn ( I 'm glad insta-love romances ) . Despite concerns I 've mentioned earlier , Last Night Telegraph Club gripping character-driven astounding historical accuracy , featuring heartwrenching & amp ; slow-burn queer relationship .

Overall : This book amazing I 'd suggest LGBTQ+ historical fiction ! 2.5 3 stars This book bunch reviews , honestly kind . The book longer needed . I 'm close 400 pages . I n't understand structure . To start section , Lo included piece timeline flashback older character ( i.e . Lily 's mother , father , aunt ) . However , things add plot . The flashbacks make Lily 's father aunt , I disappointed I n't more.Similar flashbacks lead , plot points introduced . A storyline I potential Red Scare effects Chinese Americans , storyline remains underdeveloped book . The book 's back cover synopsis makes America 's communist paranoia play bigger role narrative . The categorized historical fiction , `` historical '' part falls flat personally . To justify book 's length , I time spent part narrative . As love story , I appreciate book . I LGBTQ love story diverse perspective , Chinese American girl 1950s . Yet , I 've executed . The book called `` Last Night Telegraph Club , '' takes 100 pages ( 1/4 ) Telegraph Club . Too build ! Also , I n't feel Lily interact love interest . I Lo 've delved relationship . I wanted . That , book resonate , I 's great I diverse stories storytellers . I provided ARC Edelweiss exchange honest review.Set San Francisco 50 's , Last Night Telegraph Club tells Lily 's story . Lily 17 lives Chinatown brothers parents .

One hand , writing beautiful I author researched time period , immersive , I felt I then.One hand , dragged . It time start book , I trouble staying awake read . There 's lot happening , especially beginning . It takes long time story full start , I felt dragged . And chapters parents aunt super interesting historical level , I felt brought plot-wise . Speaking plot , ending felt bit rush I feel closure ... frustrating considering entire book dragged on.So , basically , I mixed feeling I n't I feel racial slurs . I author wrote note book Black East Asians called back wanted accurate possible felt unnecessary . But , I 'm white 's call make.Just expect lot racism homophobia.All , advice read book ! `` That book . It women , fell love . '' And Lily asked question root , unfurling leaves demanding shown sun : `` Have heard ? '' - Malinda Lo , Last Night Telegraph ClubBeing queer obstacles . Just Chinese America . This book set San Francisco 's Chinatown 1950s , combined ingredients baked delicious historical fiction.The romance book lovely bittersweet . But hooked sincere book Chinese . It 's rare find ownvoice book focuses generation immigrants , generation immigrants struggles loyalty , identity , responsibilities . This book narrated multigenerational perspective gave immersive time travelling experience . It featured Lily mum , born raised America . And dad , wanted temporary stay America pursue degree , n't back anymore due WWII China 's changing political climate . The book timelines highlighted important political personal dates I appreciated.My heart hurts Chinese Exclusion Act , discrimination faced ( facing today ) , demonization discrimination queer faced ( facing today ) .

Eine lesbische Liebesgeschichte Jahr 1954 , 50er Jahre Köpfen konservativen Rollenbildern verknüpft : Der Mann verdient Geld , Frau brav Hause , macht Haushalt kümmert Kinder .

Ich konnte Orte wunderbar vorstellen junge Lily Beobachtungen Welt gefallen . Sie beobachtet genau versucht subtilen Botschaften Szene aufzunehmen . Die Geschichte größtenteils Lilys Sicht erzählt spielt Jahr 1954 . Allerdings gibt Zeitsprünge Vergangenheit kurze Kapitel Sicht Eltern sowie Tante , deren Geschichte wenig beleuchten . Zeittafeln Abschnitt beleuchten historischen Gegebenheiten runden Bild . Mir Kombination wahnsinnig gut gefallen . Vordergründig Geschichte Lily Kath , Hintergründe lernen zusätzlich darüber , warum Menschen Lilys Umfeld reagieren , reagieren gibt historischen Einblick Zeit verbunden Herausforderungen , Falle Familie Hu bedeutet , Abschiebung droht . Gleichzeitig gibt Buch Einblick lesbische Szene Zeit . Lily sticht nochmal mehr heraus , chinesisch-amerikanisch . Ich mochte subtile Art , Umfeld beobachtet daraus Erkenntnisse zieht .

E passa soprattutto attraverso Lily , nuclei tematici scelti , cioè paura anti-comunista discriminazione cinesi , ’ nessuna reazione particolare parte protagonista renda certi eventi cruciali . Non ’ elaborazione pensieri parte , spesso recepisce informazioni modo quasi passivo : requisiscono documenti cittadinanza padre limita chiedere riavrà indietro ; rimproverano essere andata picnic Lega giovanile comunista ( descrizioni cibo posto… dire 💀 ) chiede reagiscono così riguardo collettività , né momento quel pomeriggio commentato ; citano sospetti comunismo cerchia amici , ’ esclamazione stupore aggiunge nulla ; Lily legge opuscolo comunismo scritto punto vista critica americana , curiosa , riflette così demonizzato quel paese ; così ’ scena trova opuscolo frasi giuramenti americani libertà patriottismo , chiede politica funzioni quel modo.Varie occasioni inserire sequenze riflessive state sprecate.Ed strano visto esempio paragrafo definisce politici trattati casa “ intriganti barlumi mondo adulto sembrava completamente separato realtà mondana vita quotidiana . Quando quel mondo interferiva disorientava. ” È bella frase , lascia ’ tempo trova resto libro , proprio ragazza giovane , domande questioni modo naturale giustamente capisce , caratterizza ’ origine quell ’ opposizione atti persone cinesi viene fatto passare sordina fatto aggiunga altro . Non abbastanza , direi.Soprattutto , capisco focus confronto comunità cinese-associazione comunismo-maccartismo americano , : intanto capite origini solo , già detto potevano dire altro conoscono “ clima generale paura ” basta , senza qualche puntino ; poi , fare storica puntigliosa , può parlare quel decennio America riferimenti comunismo senza parlare Guerra Fredda , russi menzionati deduzione automatica comunismo periodo , tensione tutta popolazione americana tantissimi livelli ( sì , apprezzato scena ’ esercitazione attacchi aerei esplosivi , viene spiegato , poteva dire altro visto contrasto ideologico ) .Insomma , Italia scuole superiori arriva malapena 2ª Guerra mondiale- caso corso fatto ’ università , resto specifiche politica internazionale quasi nessuno cultura generale , secondo intuizione informazioni vanno oltre.Il difficile scrivere romanzi sfondo storico proprio equilibrare cose realmente accadute storia fantasia , comunicarle bene certo può fare modo didascalico quasi commentario punto punto , devono esserci eventi sfruttare evidenziare certi elementi , incontri questioni politiche , caratterizzazioni mente narra capire parte mondo livello sociale . E può avvenire tramite pensieri , dialoghi , oggetti inseriti certi luoghi , carità aspetto info dumping stile saggio -che appunto narrativamente sbagliato- , neanche paio cose poi perse così : ” ” ” ) -•La parte interessante sicuramente Telegraph Club , descrizioni semplici rendevano benissimo ’ atmosfera lesbian bar tutta storia continuava formare ogni interazione donne . È luogo stesso Lily forma completo , conferma percorso questioning orientamento , contempo , scopre lati sé legati personalità ’ approccio sociale rendono persona nuova completa . Dalle prime scene disagio osservava sogno impossibile “ ’ attrice abiti maschili ” esibirsi pianoforte , ’ ombra seduta divanetti , pian piano comincia fare proprio spazio , mura fatte apposta accogliere comunità marginalizzata sempre pericolo . Appena legge Lily varca soglia quel locale , percepisce quel calore speranza vivere quel modo , contempo segretezza lascia ricordi angolo mente , può liberare ruolo “ brava ragazza cinese ” sempre composta perfetta famiglia scuola , può conoscere ragazze , ammirarle voler diventare , definisce “ vive ” ( ogni pensiero esempio genitori chiameranno discriminatoriamente aride passaggio ) .Il percorso Lily bellissimo , realistico ambiguità emozioni omofobia internalizzata , purtroppo proviamo società demonizza queerness , accettazione orgoglio capisce : “ Avrebbe dovuto sentirsi sporca averlo letto colpa essere così elettrizzata quel pensiero.Il problema sentiva così . Invece sentiva finalmente risolto ’ ultima parte codice scervellata così tempo ricordare nemmeno iniziato decifrarlo . Si sentiva euforica. ” “ Non cioccolato . Era trovare ’ acqua dopo siccità . Non riusciva berne abbastanza sete vergognare , sete arrabbiare. ” - & gt ; Lily capisce volere meritarselo , elimina quei residui pensieri oppressivi sapendo essere sbagliata , convincendosene ancora gruppi lesbiche frequenta Club . In modo diretto capisce potenza , viene rappresentato passaggio importante , ’ epoca , aggregarsi poteva riconoscersi vicenda.Belle spontanee descrizioni modo capisce ’ attrazione ragazze livello strettamente fisico : “ Lily visto passi club danza Schiaccianoci ogni Natale tutte scuole superiori , quell ’ anno volta consapevole ciò guardando . Le gambe ragazze ombre , curve cosce polpacci , scollatura resa visibile body . Le ballerine dovevano essere state sempre , Lily sentiva volta vedeva veramente : peso corpi , vitalità calore pelle rosa. ” …E triste presenza male gaze , parte integrante coppie etero influenza dominazione patriarcale , ciò purtroppo riflette : “ Una coppia ragazzi fila davanti Lily fischiava volontà ’ insegnante scese giù lungo corridoio metterli tacere , Lily lasciò cadere sguardo ginocchia , stata essere ammonita. ” - & gt ; Ma fortunatamente capisce poi pensieri paragonabili molestia , ’ ’ ingenuità realistica : “ C ’ differenza fischi quei ragazzi pensando , ancora sicura motivo differenza . Sapeva soltanto sentiva ipnotizzata arrossì. ” Non solo sé stessa interiormente , serate Telegraph Club , vediamo emozioni Lily includano paura vergogna , ’ incertezza gioia , conoscenza cultura tutta nuova , coppie butch/femme lesbians appaiono così diverse trasgredendo regole espressione genere , apprendendo nuova quotidianità linguaggi codice luogo può rivedersi.D ’ altronde sappiamo frequenza rischi poi concretizzazioni violenza avvenivano quei locali , attraverso raid polizia , irruzioni finivano arresti base omofoba secondo condanne solo falsità , accuse adescamento minori pedofilia , spaccio droghe condotta oscena . È stato triste interessante quel punto trama proprio notte ( “ La scorsa notte ” perifrasi piano cronologico usata titolo , riprendendo momento clue storia ) venga arrestata Kathleen , ragazza Lily love interest ’ inizio libro , vedere conseguenza risonanza intervento armato solo “ essere visti lì vicino ” , notizia giornale , spaesamento dovunque Lily andasse ’ pericolo essere sola rifiutata ( eccetto veritiera solidarietà ragazze lesbiche riferimento storico bisogno sostegni economici ) ; quei capitoli attesa disperazione scappa casa , dopo litigio madre violenza omofoba verbale fisica , ’ obbligo silenzio rispetto resto famiglia , trasferimento altro stato “ evitare pettegolezzi zona ” . Si mischia ’ esclusione pratico reputazione sociale strano clima anti-cinese già presente , percepisce qualunque cosa possa essere passo falso . Straziante terribilmente vero.-•Un ’ cosa apprezzato Lily , singolo , caratterizzazione relazioni , soprattutto amicizia Shirley : ’ ottima dimostrazione ’ amicizia tossica fin ’ inizio , passa attraverso gelosia , volere ’ altri amici , ’ addossamento sensi colpa futuro andarsene farsi ’ vita , carisma diventa disparità potere poiché Shirley sembra averne , dare buoni profondo orgoglio ’ incapacità chiedere scusa ciò Lily abituata , finire ’ omofobia aperta , quindi rapporto solo certo punto Lily mette discussione . È classica amicizia fin ’ infanzia perdonano difetti nocività stare sempre insieme condividere , avere quell ’ unica persona punto saldo , trae inganno nascondendo lati negativi.-•L ’ aspetto socio-culturale Chinatown ’ interno San Francisco poi molto interessante , descrizioni estetiche certi posti dinamiche lavorative compresi confronti turisti , ’ area solo relativamente protetta contempo molto chiusa convenzioni sociali date ’ appartenenza stessa etnia timore fuoriuscirne . Per parlare strana dinamica ’ essere cittadini americani cercare bilanciarlo ’ origine cinese , ’ espressione esempio concorso Miss Chinatown , inventato americani bianchi senso ovviamente razzista “ esotico ” sfruttando guardare donne cinesi renderle emblemi bellezza , dimostrando quel popolo poteva essere integrato paese ( tipico liberalismo idealistico accondiscendente sempre fantomatica libertà USA ) ; esso partecipa personaggio Shirley , determinata vincere mostrare essere abbastanza ’ America ancora abbastanza cinese deludere Chinatown rimanere affine gente ’ cresciuta , stato straniante sapere evento storicamente reale leggerne ’ analisi ’ autrice fine libro.Inoltre , voluto attenzioni questioni politiche , appunto , cittadinanza americana -e documenti neanche parlato dopo confisca- radici pregiudizio anti-comunista , percepisce Lily deve mantenere identità cinese contrasta , solo base regole rigide eternormative stata educata , scoperta ’ identità queer . Due mondi apparentemente possono stare insieme , effetti ragazza esempi poiché gay bar sempre ’ unica cinese.Questo porta ovviamente ’ denuncia discriminazione razzismo , strade molestie calling parte uomini bianchi , fetish persino ragazze lesbiche Club appellano “ molte così parti ” ( ciò note ’ autrice linguaggio scoperto termine “ orientale ” offensivo , ancora usava corretto cioè asioamericano nazione ) , Lily deve combattere interiormente sentirsi offesa giustamente senza bianchi rendano conto , dire nulla solo fatto aver trovato posto persone * parte * queer . Seppur setting storico , leggerlo ora reminder ’ importante ’ intersezionalità : parte minoranza rende esenti ’ avere altri privilegi , caso etnia bianca , pur sempre occhio discriminatorio automatico dentro nuocere.-• Un ’ ultima cosa , invece , parte apprezzato parte visto modo quasi neutro , relazione romantica Kath : amo friends lovers trope , ancora molto lento , piaciuta semplicità diventano amiche poi amanti attraverso vedere forti passioni ’ ’ , Lily ’ astronomia Kath volo ( giochi parole classiche frasi espressive tipo “ sentirsi sopra nuvole ’ amore ” ) , scoprire voler stare insieme trovano punto conforto recoproco . Tutto molto romantico . E abbastanza emotivo momento distacco bruscò Kath viene arrestata notte raid rimangono distanti tempo . Ma dopo finale stato compresso , ’ Epilogo brevissimo salto temporale anno aspettavo : viene usata tecnica narrativa sommario dire studiato ora lavorano due , parlano frasi veloci “ mancata ” “ dimmi ” “ amo ” promessa appuntamento ricominciare vedersi . Ma ’ pathos , descrizioni sorpresa rivedersi dopo quel caos né pensiero vogliono relazionarsi ora futuro , riprende solo ’ amore generale . Davo scontato letto almeno paio lettere scambiate , vedere modo esprimevano quel momento particolare distanza , raggiungimento sogni senza poterne parlare faccia- soprattutto parte Kath , visto sappiamo nulla -a parte ambizione lavorativa- personalità molto abbozzata , necessaria narrazione.Un peccato , salto così rapido dialogo così piatto rende chissà cosa finale.-• Altra pecca poi tante cose potevano essere meglio sostituzione scene quotidianità sì , servono ’ , ripetute chissà quante- dialoghi migliore amica riguardo ballo studentesco , ’ uscita prendere gelato ( ripetuta seconda volta altro posto infatti praticamente uguale😭 ) , movimenti casa compiti fare , aule scuola… Molto inutili , accompagnati pensieri , nuovo , quotidiana adolescenza apprezzare , scene routine giorni dovrebbero dire qualcosa.Così capitoli punto vista madre , padre zia- carino sapere background soprattutto famiglia cinese ’ influenza culturale nucleo sociale , apportavano molto , venivano ripresi membri famigliari negativoInsomma- A volte , soprattutto parte , scene peculiarità ’ essere minime azioni già , quei capitoli diventavano vuoti.—————————————————————————Comunque , fin fine , bel libro consiglio , poteva fare . Ho amato ovviamente note storiche ’ autrice fine , linguaggio scrittura cinese , comunità queer generale lesbica specifico definizioni sub-culturali , interviste racconti poetessa lesbica ’ donna parlato significato essere lesbica cinese quel periodo ; oppure comunità immigrati cinesi funzionavano migrazioni , addirittura raccontato arrivati nonni famiglia personaggio Lily parte ispirata . L ’ trovato adorabile 🥹✨Rimane piacevole YA coming age racconta storia letta , soprattutto Italia ancora necessario tradurre libri queer giovani , soprattutto femminile . Pur parlando periodo storico doveva partire giradischi locale nascosto evadere silenzio oppressivo , dà comunque quel barlume nota musicale dolcezza , Lily Kath tornate insieme fine , tante possano farlo futuro , dobbiamo ricordare passato sociale fatto propri club , rischiando pur essere stesse🤞❤️🏳️‍🌈—-QUOTES🌈 : - “ Haven ’ wondered keeping attached ground ? “ - “ She ’ hard time ’ expected .

RecommendationIf interested cultural differences gender preference 1950s , book presents accurate examples . This depicted context historical background Asian American San Francisco fight discrimination biases persevere . It book young young adults . It longer entertaining worth reading . I remember reading Malinda Lo ’ Ash , long ago , story stick mind filmic blear . Something Lo ’ writing , tweaks existing stories , left impression . Reading Last Night Telegraph Club , historical YA focused coming age Lily Hu , eldest daughter Chinese-American immigrant family , I felt impressed Lo ’ writing . She managed balance number complex historical threads affecting story , positioned intersection race sexual identity.The existence Chinese-American immigrants adapting nationalist doctrine political fears . Before movement establish Asian American solidarity built momentum , Asian communities residing coasts splintered historical forces . Last Night Telegraph Club captures fears Chinese community , Japanese communities rounded internment camps lands dispossessed WW1 . Caught bipolar ideological capitalism communism , Lily ’ family friends present respectable , American , means curtailment ’ hopes dreams . Lo writes engagingly community San Francisco ’ Chinatown businesses associations compose . Her parents feature interludes outline backgrounds – father scholar America learn medicine , mother American-born nurse . Their involvement WW1 specifically highlighted , reminding lingering traumas subtly impacts relationship Lily , expectations hold her.What intrigues Lo ’ focus queer history – particular experiences queer Asians . It fascinating read level research Lo conducted making book . I ’ inclined believe Lo ’ presentation 50 ’ queer culture . And Lo soften blow racism– portions book I felt deeply uncomfortable reading Lily treated navigating white-dominant queer spaces . There inherent risk queer , queer Chinese period struck incredibly lonely . The worst consequences avoided , steered Lo ’ plot characters – fact lampshaded neatly Lo ’ inclusion lesbian pulp romance novels plot – I Lo ’ characters suffer painful consequences interactions . Yes , young adult book , ’ handwave experiences racism homophobia away . In , differs Benjamin Alire Saenz ’ book , Aristotle Dante Dive Waters World , nominated 2021 Goodreads award ( read review ) , worse . In fact , I appreciated grittiness setting.The strength Lo ’ writing lies characters , ambition plot realism setting . Meticulously researched , makes absorbing read . The history represents I welcome YA literature . 4.5/5I loved book . Lo deft tackling nuanced topics interwoven seamlessly . I wish I book read teenager / college student . While I exhibited sapphic tendencies child , solidified brain I college . I text relate allowed notice claim lot earlier , particularly n't n't stories queer Asian women time I . There layers book resonated : means Asian American , `` '' American , `` '' Chinese girl , understanding means different love things interested . Outside sexuality , shows complex coming-of-age story outgrowing friends wish grow past history friendship dictated . It story Chinese family experience , community easily shattered making individualistic decisions deemed reckless immorally wrong.I loved chapters different perspectives inclusion real life historical events . I feel I learned hometown Bay Area ( albeit SF ) history Asian American ( Chinatowns , communism ) LGBT communities . I loved showed Lily exploring sexuality understanding deeper level , safe spaces explore feelings necessarily safe spaces Asian woman . These spaces predominantly white outright racist , micro-aggressions present today predominantly white spaces , queer otherwise.My qualm I wish time spent perspectives Lily 's mother , father , aunt , I wish moments Lily siblings aunt . I added extra layer impact final conflict resolution point . Having characters fully developed made readers reasoning choices made book . I especially loved small moments Lily brothers uncomplicated unconditionally love present Lily 's parents . It nice moments , moments support Lily 's life Kath.This book I definitely recommend .

Her descriptions San Francisco 's Chinatown 1950s America make Lily 's family neighbours alive . I loved veracity Lo 's writing colouring Lily 's Chinese heritage - actual Chinese words dialogue ( paired footnotes , naturally ) .Now , - I 'll confess I n't entirely enjoy reading experience . Personally , Lo 's writing favours functional expository , fault . I feeling , especially book wore , judiciously edited . Is describe single action , single Lily sees particular scene , forgetting add flesh colour emotion 's key supporting characters ? By , I Kathleen Miller , course , remains frustratingly opaque . She 's entirely personality-free , exists purely serve Lily 's story . This means I cared relationship affecting Lily . There 's chemistry here.It 's weird , , book takes veeeeery long Lily 's story beginning - painstakingly - final act , big , awful , weighty things happen , feels rushed perfunctory . The weighting feels ; Lo offers abundance detail depth , I . tl ; dr I enjoyed I issues pacing plotting , especially . REALLY glad exists ! 3.5 stars ( 7.1/10 ) - ⭐⭐⭐💫 Content warnings found Last Night Telegraph Club set 1950s San Francisco , Chinese-American high school student Lily starting figure attraction women . Together friend Kath , starts frequenting lesbian night club , quickly realizes consequences new-found reality . This book bit weird review . At hand , I 1950s setting combination Lily 's sexuality culture unique , I n't fully speak representation , I well-rounded nuanced . My issue , , setting backdrop fully explored aspect story , book fell short . Part completely fault , I picked book impression adult historical fiction , YA . With expectation in-depth exploration threat gay community form raids nightclubs , horrid treatment Chinese-Americans time fear communism extremely high . Yet , aspects present story promised blurb , put background coming age story frankly n't interest . While I Lily accurate product time environment , I found lackluster muted . And emphasis questioning sexuality , n't meat story fully invested . I interested lives adult women frequented Telegraph Club , 's simply book . So book I fault appreciated topics , n't fully book . Judging ratings , , definitely found audience , I recommend market story . To completely honest , I ’ hard time figuring I feel book . I ’ sitting 1:00am finishing I ’ mixed bag emotions.On hand , beautiful engaging story queer communities lift times time support tragedy . But I I misled bit folks recommended book . I told feel-good queer story I ’ honest , make feel good.I 1950s awful time queer , . But time book progressed , I angry hurt . I accurate portrayal ’ hard swallow . Even lines absolutely gut-wrenching , Lily acknowledging kiss Kath goodbye public . It ’ raw reminder queer communities . And alive today . It makes cry.And honestly ending made feel angry . More felt unfair abrupt , Lily felt course . However , satisfying conclusion . The epilogue gave bit closure . I felt story instead ran dry . We missed episode .

No trata libro necesitaba leer justo momento , atrapó primeras páginas partir ahí supe iba parar . Ha momentos lectura levantaba daba vueltas pasillo emocionada podía leer desahogarme primero . He releído párrafos , escenas páginas vez , despierta 3 mañana , quisiera terminar capítulo irme dormir cuerpo obligaba seguir leyendo.No libro perfecto menos : subtrama queda resolver ( aunque manera siento tampoco necesitaba resuelta , pues autora quería enseñar hecho ) , desenlace trama principal parecido precipitado últimas páginas . Pero duele especialmente epílogo sido corto conciso quedaba contar . Aun así , puedo darle menos 5 estrellas ( daría 500 pudiera ) todas emociones evocado principio final . Me hecho sentir visible , orgullosa , impaciente escenas , impotente rabiosa . No leído mucha ficción histórica vida , justo encontrarme libro hecho darme cuenta sienta formar parte pequeño trocito esta.Aunque novela general desarrolla ambiente super hostil , pues retrato homofobia 1950 , ternura indescriptible leer relación protagonista interés romántico solidaridad lésbica . El proceso autodescubrimiento aceptación Lily durísimo leer , vez llena orgullo felicidad ver aceptándose progresivamente misma , llega momento ninguna manera reniega identidad . Es libro recomiendo leer , siempre cuenta triggers . ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ - 4.5 starsMalinda Lo transport different world I reading . I 'm convinced 's favorite author I 've read books .

I recommend . This book phenomenal job encapsulating girl ’ journey awareness queer identity Chinese American identity . While navigating complex nuances racism , homophobia , gender inequality shifting sentiments 1950s , Lily remains loyal whilst dreaming big outer space , exploring childhood friendships , handling family tension , discovering loves . When Lily uncovers queer identity parents , I found metaphor feeling “ stuck broken track diorama ” particularly memorable . Lily feels torn upholding cultural precedent remaining “ Chinese girl ” expected versus embracing “ otherness ” queer rigid nice society expects . Yet , chooses conform societal expectations , finds solace community discovers Telegraph Club ’ heartwarming belonging blossom book.Kath ’ character flashbacks book fell short . It felt Kath ’ character fully explored tool helping Lily dream big explore queer identity . I character bit layers added develop relationship bit . Additionally , flashbacks provide context family ’ backgrounds , felt bit detached related Lily ’ journey felt intermissions story adding flow.Nonetheless , book great read I author amazing job typing historical context 1950s Lily navigates identity young , despite changing landscape opposing social norms . Queer history important . I hear stories , faced challenges know.Malinda Lo writes beautiful lesbian love 1950s San Fransico . To read gay nightclubs history . What ?

Lo wrote history , difficulty finding stories queer colour , specifically Asian stories . To read enlightening , communist views time , history immigration . This book enlightening ways . “ Are girls book ? Because I I am. ” , I wish I absolutely love book reviewers , SO slow . I force reading times I wanted read fanfic manga literally hold attention . Every time exciting interesting happened book I 'd gripped story , narration immediately grind halt cutting flashback important plot happen , Lily listening talk n't interact all.The character story Lily Hu , 17 year Chinese-American girl lives Chinatown San Francisco mid 1950s . The setting story incredibly interesting , San Francisco 's Chinatown oldest Chinatown US , San Francisco rich queer history . Lily started figure attracted women , fixated newspaper clipping male impersonator local club . When starts closer schoolmate , Kath , Kath tells 's club Lily , Lily interested decides eve makes anxious.In parts story flashbacks times told Lily 's mother , Lily 's father , Lily 's aunt 's perspectives . I n't find stories added plot probably added extra context period history book set in.Overall , book researched interesting historical references , writing style extremely dry plot slow drawn-out . When I heard book year , I knew I read . Queer historical YA set San Francisco ? Yes , ! And I living San Francisco reading made reading experience memorable . Lo incredible job recreating San Francisco 1950s . Her descriptions City food vivid , cinematic , plain delectable . Because I knew streets neighborhood present day , I easily transported back 1950s San Francisco Chinatown . I picture walking Grant Avenue eating egg tart . I picture walking North Beach Coit Tower beautiful view bay . I picture dirty racist comments slurred . And I ’ hard xenophobia rampant exact city neighborhood today , 67 years later.1954 time girls married high school , same-sex relationships unnatural Red Scare paranoia constantly threatened livelihood Chinese community . And Lo wonderful job weaving societal constructs intersectionality Lily ’ identity , 17-year-old Chinese American protagonist .

She Telegraph Club Tommy Andrews , male impersonator . And develops feelings classmate , Kath , discovering sexual identity — direct opposition image “ Chinese girl ” . Because “ Chinese girl ” queer definitely Communist . Lo delicately examines Lily ’ struggles self-identity queer woman Chinese community ’ struggles combating xenophobia , turn , highlights issue immigrant person color deals — fitting . A beautiful story self-discovery , loves , found family , voice lost history—queer Asian American women.CW : sexism , misogyny , xenophobia , racism , racial slurs , deportation , death loved , homophobia , mention miscarriageThank Penguin Teen gifted finished copy .

However , blurb , I focused historical aspects , I picked book , instead stuck inside Lily 's head relationship chemistry made ( I , brilliant make-out scene , ) . I failed connect Lily character . She inoffensive , felt barely personality - I read Shirley Judy , interesting characters , side characters I struggled track irrelevant . Overall , book pretty frustrating , lot potential n't follow . It 100 pages unfortunately n't save rest book writing style n't lot time , objectively . However , sapphic , bonus points - probably recommend hesitantly love I 'm definitely book 's biggest . book Lily slowly discovering sexuality realistic .

Also , butch femme representation unexpected completely welcome lovely . Did book make type long review ? ? Wow Very nicely book girl coming age discovering gayness . Lily , high school senior San Francisco 's Chinatown , brought dutiful Chinese-American daughter . It 's '50s , 's expected fit stereotyped female role . Her family educated forward-thinking times , math science fiction aspire computer JPL . But discovers attraction women ( butch women ! ) , 's boundaries acceptable . ( I born 13 years Lily , I heard gay college , gay women . Yes , SF different , ... gay back , lot chutzpah figure . ) Besides , book takes casual sexism racism times . At lesbian club , Lily Asian person , comments ( `` We rarely Orientals '' calling `` China doll '' ) . Similar things happen pretty ventures Chinatown . Then 's Communist scare witch hunt , affects Lily 's physician father . All themes interwoven nicely . Though 's young adult book , 's written fairly sophisticated reader . There 's high school drama ( Lily 's friend self-centered queen bee nice problem ) , Lily avoidant making clear ( ignore fact male friend crush ) . But Lily feeling , steadily .

Wspaniała historia , nie tylko przyjaźni czy miłości , przede wszystkim poznawaniu siebie ! Nie często zdarza się myśleć książce niemalże w każdej wolnej chwili . Tej historii zgodnie moim oczekiwaniami udało się osiągnąć ! ! Jedyne , czego mogę mieć jakieś zastrzeżenia , zakończenie . Pomijając już fakt , że nie przepadam typem zakończeniem , mam wrażenie , że było bardzo szybkie ? Czuję przez lekki niedosyt . Przez też cały czas łapie się myśleniu , że nie skończyłam jeszcze książki . Niektóre sceny były też trochę bez sensu , nie wnosiły kompletnie nic fabuły . Jednak dwie kwestie nie są czymś , co wpłynęłoby drastycznie ocenę historii .

I love Lily Kath I give big warm hug 🫂 I hope happy ending absolutely deserve Zbierałam się trochę , żeby napisać ocenę , nie ukrywając nie chce się 👍👍 Ogólnie pomysł fabuły się spodobał już samym początku , trochę czasu zajęło , wkręcić się w akcję , nie jest tam zbyt dużo dialogów , co nie ułatwiało sytuacji , ostatecznie się udało , co sprawiło , że teraz w głowie mam wspomnienia , które przypominają urywki serialu/filmu . Interesuje mnie temat , jaki porusza książka problem , jaki wskazuje . Mimo , że czas akcji dzieje się kilka dekad , ludzie cały czas stykają się sytuacjami , w jakiej znalazła się główna bohaterka mogą się nią utożsamiać . Postacie były dosyć oryginalne , zwłaszcza jedna pobocznych bohaterek ( shirley , której nie lubię ) . W ogólnym zarysie książka była ciekawa , była czymś , co mnie interesowało daje myślenia , jednak odkładając ją półkę w trakcie czytania , nie miałam chęci niej powrócić , praktycznie musiałam się zmuszać , wiedziałam , że nie jest WCIĄGAJĄCA , jedynie ciekawa . Dlatego dałam 3 gwiazdki 💋 A fresh , tender , queer Asian-American coming age story set 1950 's SF Chinatown . The experience making choices grain expected — family , community , hegemonic society — universal ~come age~ , I related aspects Lily 's experience I especially weepy .

While dealing senior year school , threats Communism deportation , Lily befriends Kathleen 'Kath ' Miller . Together start meeting secret Lesbian bar , called Telegraph Club watch ' male impersonator ' perform . The pair develop close , secret friendship blossoms more.Thoughts : Five Things I loved book:1 . The Premise : This book intriguing time I heard basic idea . Historical fiction same-sex relationships AND interracial relationships I 've . The book tells modern story , un-modern time . I love writer n't racism major plot point , references historical context , fact girls different races mentioned.2 . Lily Kath : The girls cute ! They share interest Maths . Lily work spaceships , Kath pilot . While Lily 's friends dismiss dreams , Kath supportive , vice versa . The romance slightly slow-burn takes awhile , cute lead-up . Their relationship evolves naturally share secret club , selves.3 . The writing style : The writer included flashbacks Lily 's parents America section . It included timeline , important family events , important historical events give context family history . I loved glimpses , I expect lead big revelation , fun read.4 . Baby Sapphics meet Older Sapphics : Lily Kath befriends slightly older Lesbians attending Telegraph Club . I loved inclusion , showed girls n't world , hope . Lily shy starts attending club , starts open learn world women club.5 . The Setting : Chinatown 1950s San Francisco interesting backdrop story . In post-war years , China dealing communism , fear . It time period setting I previously read , intriguing . The girls practice air raid attack , planning dances dealing boys.Representation : BIPOC : - Lily ( MC ) , friends family Chinese-American living Chinatown . They shown eating traditional food , celebrating Chinese New Year speaking Cantonese . - Kath ( Love Interest ) Italian-American.LGBT : - This book female-female romance , Lily Kath . Both identify homosexual liking girls , explicit 'Lesbian ' labelling , display interest boys . They attend Telegraph Club meet Lesbians , Butch Femme.OWN VOICES : - Malinda Lo identifies Asian-American Lesbian , representations classified voices rep. ¿Qué puedo decir ?

Sprawiło , że podczas czytania poczułam się zrozumiana . Książka porusza ogrom bardzo ważnych tematów . Fakt , że okoliczności oparte są prawdziwych zdarzeniach przeszłości czyni ją jeszcze bardziej ważną.Osobiście wszystko książka nie jest końca dla mnie .

If I n't , I 'd author Malinda Lo lived San Francisco time period historical spans , 1954 . She captures paranoia Red Scare , xenophobia , pressure peers parents perfectly choosing words story love . It 's gentle story fully aware societal dangers girls falling love . Today 's readers realize time police raids bars catered gay/lesbian clientele .

Her story fascinating engaging merit , set historical context interwoven snippets stories family members , takes importance . I n't reader fall love Lily wonder book life . I 've enjoyed Lo 's prior works , glad I picked latest . It departure I read ( historical fiction swing idealistic/unrealistic OR depressing hell ) Lo found give happy ending transporting vividly San Fransisco , USA 1950s ( shudder ) . This book extraordinarily researched ( check 9 page Author 's Note 2 page Bibliography n't believe ) shone book 's delivery made book enjoyable read . It Sarah Waters-y , detail things I n't ( e.g . skirts , stockings , etc. ) . That , great job acknowledging political climate time tainted lives queer white Chinese/Chinese Americans.Speaking queer white , I adored romance book ( love friends-to-lovers slow burn ) . And I loved Kath noticed Lily , , pushed , admitted bit lip solving math problems , especially context racist white book Lily 's appearance.If I nit-picky I n't 5 stars , I 'd things on:1 . The book felt bit familiar , well-trodden path . The manipulative friend . The beauty pageant . The unsupportive parents . The 1/3rd 1/3rd 1/3rd formulaic nature book 's plot ( literally page 130 , page 262 `` big plot points '' happened ) . Aside well-researched , previously unwritten POV time period , lot felt unoriginal.2 . There stylistic decisions I n't added book . For , timelines subsection confusing . Also , I n't chapters written Lily 's mom/dad/aunt 's perspectives enhance book probably scrapped . Again , loved , shrug . I character multi-faceted book looked intersectionality . That I wish ending conclusive , I realize ending probably realistic . Para mim livro 4.5 estrelas , 4 5 estrelas livro sáfico , representantividade asiática , prefiro 5.A /única/ coisa desagradou nesse livro final , pareceu pouco corrido algumas `` respostas '' , mesmo.Para procurando romance lésbico leve tom político fala bastante preconceito racial pessoas amarelas , fique martelando questão heterossexualidade compulsória , livro você.Gostaria falar SIM gatilhos , sendo maior homofobia , vinda família personagem principal , outros personagens.Fora , AMEI leitura , super fluída consegui idendificar vários momentos Lily pensando .

Achich , tohle přesně kniha mého gusta . Překrásně napsaný , pomalý , něžný příběh dvou obyčejných dívkách , které sobě postupně nalézají zalíbení . Rozměr tomu dodává fakt , odehrává 50. letech , takže vám určitě jasné , doba lesbickému vztahu zrovna moc nepřála . Nejen , vás čekalo silné nepochopení rodiny , podobný vztah byl vlastně určité míry trestný.Další hloubku tomuto příběhu dodává fakt , hlavní hrdinka Lily Američanka čínského původu . V té době byl USA obří strašák komunismus , takže podezření toho , jste čínský špión , mohlo vzniknout jakéhokoliv důvodu . A právě , rodina Lily čelí jak cítí , má příběhu stejně velké množství prostoru jako její první láska.Nebudu vám lhát , tahle kniha není pro každého . A už jen tím , patří spíš těm těžším knížkám angličtině . Ale jestli hledáte něco pomalého , citlivého , co vám ukáže svět zas trochu jinýma očima , zkuste . Osobně jsem měla při čtení stejné pocity jako když jsem četla The Miseducation Cameron Post Emily M. Danforth , jestli vám Cameron též líbila , rozhodně musíte zkusit tohle.Každopádně tohle první kniha , kterou rok 2022 zahrnu mezi nejlepší čtení . Gay marriage legalized America 2015 50 states .

THE ENDING AHHHHH PLEASE A SEQUEL PLEASE ! ! ! 4.5// rtc ! I offer review book email , NetGalley excited Malinda Lo book coming ( , ’ ) . I ’ previous books , despite fact things differently , politically.A warning conservative readers : lesbian coming-of-age story . While ’ particularly graphic , ’ usual stuff ’ expect young adult romance novel.Anyway , story Lily Hu , Chinese girl living ’ 50s San Francisco . She lives Chinatown parents brothers . She ’ seventeen senior year high school , discovering male impersonator Tommy Andrews newspaper , ends schoolmate Kathleen Miller ( ‘ Kath ’ short ) light . She realizes ’ gay , discovers Kath gay , , begin making clandestine nighttime trips lesbian club called The Telegraph Club , Tommy Andrews performs.When I started , I knew author lot research time period gay culture San Francisco , alive . It fascinating , I ’ Bay Area ( north , Solano county ) . Life Lily community ’ easy , hysteria surrounding communism fact early years Cold War . The authorities suspicious Chinese immigrants due fact timeframe , China fell Mao Zedong ’ Communist Party .

This ’ veteran World War 2.Yes , things tough non-white back , San Francisco , , Montgomery , Alabama . The author shy away terms back , “ oriental ” “ negro ” . Lily friends encounter casual racism , ’ horrible blacks encounter Deep South . Still , I find deeply grateful US ’ anymore .

Some terms romanized , translated footnotes.As noted , separated parts , parts chapters told parents aunt ’ point view , timeline important historical events time period . I afraid author sympathetic communism , ’ big part . Plenty Lily ’ family friends definitely fond communism , resentful suspected communist sympathies ties due nationality and/or ethnicity , understandable.The romance Lily Kath slow , romance . I kind wish happened sooner , felt long , probably ’ alternate chapters , I found fascinating.Things fine Telegraph Club police raid place arrest owner Tommy Andrews . Even homosexuals allowed legally gather time , club owner patrons suspected luring underage teenagers club , supposedly plied alcohol drugs . After , Lily eventually parents , risk offering spoilers , ’ well.The kind sad bittersweet , I ’ spoil bit Lily Kath happy ending . It ’ kind anti-climactic , happy ending.Anyway , I ’ I , I ended enjoying , especially view Chinese culture , , Japanese Korean culture , fascinates me.The book contains lengthy author ’ note adding context story discussing history research .
